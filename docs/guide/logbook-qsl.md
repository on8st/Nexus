# Logbook & QSL

The logbook is Nexus's system of record: a persistent ADIF 3.1.4 store with full
round-trip fidelity. It holds callsign, grid, entity, state, band, frequency,
mode, the string RSTs each mode actually uses (FT8's "−12" and CW's "599" are
both first-class), name/QTH, notes, POTA/SOTA references, and a per-QSO upload
state for every online service — so "what has actually been uploaded where"
survives restarts.

## The tour

Each row is one QSO. The columns you'll use most:

- **Call, band, mode, date/time, RST** — the contact itself.
- **Entity / DXCC** — resolved from cty.dat, first-class in the table.
- **QSL** — *which source* confirmed the contact:
  - **L** — LoTW,
  - **C** — a paper card,
  - **E** — eQSL.

  Hover for the eligibility tooltip. **eQSL is clearly labelled non-award**: an
  E confirmation counts as a confirmation but not toward DXCC/WAS (ARRL doesn't
  accept eQSL). This matters — see [Awards & Journey](awards-journey.md).

**Search** matches callsigns *and grids*. The **"needs confirmation"** chip
beside the search box filters to contacts without an award-eligible (LoTW/paper)
confirmation — a QSL you've *requested* but not received still counts as
unconfirmed and stays in that list.

## Core workflows

### Add or edit a QSO by hand

Press **Log QSO** for the manual entry form. It seeds the draft from **what you
were actually running**: log a contact from the [Phone cockpit](phone.md) and the
draft says SSB, from [CW](cw.md) it says CW — no more accidental "FT8" voice
contacts. Edit any field inline; the store round-trips to ADIF, so an export
re-imports without loss.

When the open form stands taller than the pane holding it — 1024×768 at a large
UI zoom is where you meet this — the pane scrolls and the **Log** button that
commits the contact is one drag away. It is a scrollbar rather than more room:
nothing moves at any window size where the form already fits.

### Upload to LoTW

1. Set your **LoTW Station Location** (and optionally the TQSL path) in
   [Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors](settings-reference.md#confirmations).
   Nexus signs through *your installed TQSL* against that named Station Location
   — no certificate or password is stored by Nexus.
2. Click **Upload to LoTW** in the logbook. The button shows the count of
   un-uploaded QSOs; it signs and uploads the unsent batch. If you would rather
   not remember, turn on **Upload to LoTW automatically** in the same Settings
   group and Nexus runs that batch every few hours. It stops and waits for you if
   a batch is ever refused, and it is unavailable while *Sign from ADIF location*
   is on — that mode signs everything from wherever you are now, so it needs you
   to pick the moment.
3. Pull confirmations back with **Download confirmations** (Settings ▸ Logging &
   Connectors ▸ LoTW). That button only goes one way, *down*; the upload is step 2
   above. The first pull covers your whole history; later ones are incremental.
   Pulling also
   marks which of *your* uploads LoTW holds on file, so a pending contact reads
   "waiting on the other op," not "never uploaded."

   Purging the logbook resets that incremental position, so the next sync after a
   purge pulls your whole history again rather than only what LoTW has matched
   since you last synced.

   You can also feed Nexus a report you downloaded from the LoTW website by hand —
   either **Sync confirmations** (which only ever updates contacts you already
   have) or **Import ADIF** works. Import adds any contacts the file has that you
   lack *and* applies the confirmations and award credits to the ones you already
   hold; its toast reports the two separately, so "0 imported, 24,163 existing QSOs
   updated" is the normal and correct result for a confirmation download.

### Push a single QSO to QRZ / ClubLog / HRDLog / WRL

Auto-upload (configured per service in
[Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors](settings-reference.md#confirmations)) pushes
each QSO as you log it. When one fails — a service was down, a key was
wrong — the logbook gives you a **per-row re-push** for **QRZ**, **ClubLog**,
**HRDLog.net**, and **World Radio League** so you can retry that one contact
after fixing the cause. A "duplicate" result is the benign "already there"
answer, not an error.

### World Radio League

Paste your WRL API key in Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors and it is verified
against your WRL account the moment you save it — your destination logbook is
found automatically. From then on every contact flows to WRL as you log it (the
auto-push switch is beside the key), and each logbook row carries a WRL button
for anything logged earlier. Bringing an existing log across? **Export for WRL**
writes an ADIF shaped for WRL's own bulk importer — the right road for thousands
of historical contacts, which would otherwise trickle through a rate-limited
API one at a time.

### Mark a QSL sent

When you send a card or request, record it on the contact with **Mark QSL sent**,
choosing the method — **bureau**, **direct**, or **electronic**. The row then
shows a quiet "QSL sent … via …" note. Marking a request sent does **not**
confirm the contact — it stays in the "needs confirmation" list until the reply
comes back.

### Understand why a contact isn't confirmed

A per-QSO **diagnostics** view explains why award credit hasn't landed yet — no
upload sent, waiting on the partner, a date mismatch — with one-click fixes where
they exist. Reconciliation tolerates ±1 day of midnight skew and matches by
mode-class, so an FT4-vs-FT8 labelling difference doesn't orphan a confirmation.

## How uploads flow

Uploads happen in the **backend log funnel**: when a QSO is logged, the
configured connectors push it. You don't push from the logbook UI for the
auto-upload path — the per-row buttons are for *recovery* when an automatic push
failed. Credentials live only in the **OS keychain**; the Connections panel reads
back presence ("credential stored"), never the secret itself.

## Honest limits

- **eQSL never counts toward LoTW-grade awards** — it's a separate confirmation
  tier, enforced everywhere credit is computed.
- **HRDLog.net and World Radio League are logging/awards sites, not ARRL
  confirmation sources** — an upload there never earns DXCC/WAS credit.
- **Nexus doesn't store your TQSL certificate or LoTW signing password** — LoTW
  signing is delegated to your installed TQSL.
