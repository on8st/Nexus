# Logbook and Awards

Nexus keeps a persistent ADIF logbook that drives offline award tracking, per-source confirmation accounting, five outbound upload connectors, two inbound confirmation syncs, and a shipped gamification layer called Journey — all from a single QSO record that survives restarts and round-trips cleanly through standard ADIF.

---

## QSO Record Fields

Every logged contact stores: callsign, Maidenhead grid, DXCC country, US state (two-letter postal), band, frequency (MHz), mode (free string — "FT8", "CW", "SSB", or anything), RST sent/received (free strings; accepts "599", "59", or "-12"), name, QTH, comment, notes, TX power (watts), start time, optional end time, and POTA/SOTA activation and hunter references for both sides of the contact.

The record also carries per-source upload state for each outbound connector (LoTW, eQSL, QRZ Logbook, ClubLog), two confirmation flags (`confirmed` and `award_confirmed` — see below), `credit_granted`, and `credit_submitted` vectors that mirror LoTW's CREDIT_GRANTED/CREDIT_SUBMITTED ADIF fields.

**Every ADIF field survives an import.** Fields Nexus does not model (COUNTY, contest exchanges, QSL dates, and anything else another logger wrote) are preserved verbatim on the record and re-emitted on every export. Modelled fields are re-emitted in normalized form (trimmed, canonical case); a value too malformed to parse degrades to its field's empty state rather than aborting the import. IOTA is stored and displayed.

---

## ADIF Import and Export

Nexus implements ADIF v3.1.4 as a lossless round-trip. The fields Nexus models (including
the numeric DXCC entity, PROP_MODE/SAT_NAME for satellite credit, OPERATOR and
STATION_CALLSIGN) serialize with correct ADIF tag names, length prefixes, and
TIME_ON/TIME_OFF/QSO_DATE encoding — ADIF's 4-digit HHMM time form is accepted on import,
and a record whose source carried no time of day is exported without a fabricated TIME_ON.
Fields Nexus does not model are preserved verbatim per record and re-emitted on export, so
importing a master log from another logger loses nothing. App-specific upload state is
carried in four `APP_TEMPO_UL_*` app-defined fields, so an exported ADIF file preserves the
full sync state when re-imported.

Import deduplication keys on call (upper-cased) + band (lower-cased) + mode (upper-cased) +
the exact QSO timestamp — the same station worked twice on one day (a rover from two grids,
a second contact after an opening) stays two records, while a true re-import of the same
file adds zero records; every entry is returned as skipped, not duplicated.

A deduplicated row is **merged, not discarded**. "Already in the log" answers *do not log
this contact twice*; it never meant *ignore what this row knows about the contact you have*.
So an import also upgrades the records it matched: confirmations (`QSL_RCVD`,
`LOTW_QSL_RCVD`, `EQSL_QSL_RCVD`), `CREDIT_GRANTED`/`CREDIT_SUBMITTED`, and the
STATE/COUNTRY detail that a confirmation row carries and an ordinary log row does not. The
merge is the same monotonic one the confirmation-sync path uses — it only ever adds, so no
import can un-confirm or un-credit a contact, and re-importing the same file twice changes
nothing the second time. The import result reports these separately as `updated`, because
they are invisible in the QSO count: an import that adds zero contacts can be the one that
repairs every award total.

ADIF spells a held confirmation two ways, and both are read: `Y` (received) and `V`
(verified — an award credit has been granted against it), the value Club Log and DXKeeper
write for a credited QSO. `N`, `R` (requested — asked for, not received) and `I`
(ignore/invalid) are not confirmations and never promote one. LoTW's own report emits only
`Y`/`N`.

POTA and SOTA references round-trip through standard ADIF field names (`MY_SIG`/`MY_SIG_INFO`/`SIG`/`SIG_INFO` for POTA/WWFF; `MY_SOTA_REF`/`SOTA_REF` for SOTA), so exports upload cleanly to pota.app and the SOTA database without custom extensions.

---

## Source-Aware Confirmation: Why It Matters

Award bodies treat confirmation sources differently. The ARRL counts a DXCC contact only when confirmed via LoTW or a paper (bureau/direct) QSL card. eQSL is not an accepted DXCC confirmation source.

Nexus enforces this distinction at the record level:

| Source | `confirmed` | `award_confirmed` |
|---|---|---|
| LoTW (`LOTW_QSL_RCVD=Y`) | true | **true** |
| Paper QSL (`QSL_RCVD=Y`) | true | **true** |
| eQSL (`EQSL_QSL_RCVD=Y`) | true | false |

Every award computation — DXCC, Challenge, Honor Roll, WAZ, WAS — uses `award_confirmed` exclusively. An eQSL-only contact counts as confirmed for your own records but never inflates an official award total. This distinction is maintained at every reconcile merge, ADIF import, and awards query; it cannot be overridden by re-importing.

---

## Awards Engine

Award tracking is computed entirely offline from the logbook using cty.dat entity resolution — no internet connection is required.

**Shipped awards:**

- **DXCC** — worked and confirmed counts toward 100 entities; per-band and per-mode (CW / Phone / Digital) breakdowns
- **DXCC Challenge** — entity × band slots (160–6m) toward 1000
- **DXCC Honor Roll** — confirmed entities within 9 of the current DXCC total; `#1 Honor Roll` flag when you hold every current entity; "N to #1" metric displayed
- **5-Band DXCC** — coverage on 80/40/20/15/10m simultaneously
- **WAZ** — 40 CQ zones, resolved from entity for contacts whose callsign maps cleanly to a zone
- **WAS** — 50 US states
- **5-Band WAS** — WAS across five bands

CQ zone (WAZ) is derived from cty.dat entity resolution. Contacts whose callsign cannot be resolved to a DXCC entity do not advance WAZ. No IOTA, WWFF, or Worked-All-Grids tracking is present.

The Awards view includes a per-QSO confirmation diagnostics panel. It lists the reason each contact is not yet credited (not uploaded, waiting on partner, recently worked, mode-class mismatch, etc.) and provides action affordances: LoTW contacts get a live one-click Upload / Re-upload button (shelling out to TQSL) — and the same batch can be run on a timer with **Upload to LoTW automatically** in Settings; QRZ, ClubLog, and eQSL contacts show guidance chips but no in-app bulk-upload path.

---

## LoTW Sync (Two-Pull Incremental)

LoTW confirmation sync uses a two-pull flow that runs when you click Sync in the Awards or Logbook view:

1. **Pull 1 — confirmations** (`qso_qsl=yes`): fetches new QSLs using the stored `APP_LoTW_LASTQSL` high-water timestamp as the `qso_qslsince` cursor, so only records newer than your last sync are downloaded. The cursor advances only after a successful fetch and only if your LoTW username has not changed during the fetch.

2. **Pull 2 — own-echo** (`qso_qsl=no`): fetches your own uploaded QSOs bounded by the oldest in-flight upload date, promoting Pending uploads to Accepted without scanning your entire logbook.

This lets Nexus distinguish "never uploaded" from "uploaded, waiting on partner" — a distinction single-pull tools cannot make.

**LoTW upload** shells out to your installed TQSL binary with:
```
tqsl -d -u -x -a compliant -l <station_location> <adif_path>
```
TQSL exit codes are classified: 0 or 9 → Pending, 8 → Duplicate (benign), 11 → None (no network stamp, retryable), 5 + cert/location error in stderr → AuthFail, anything else → Rejected.

TQSL is auto-detected from OS default locations before falling back to `PATH`:
- **Windows:** `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\TrustedQSL\tqsl.exe`, then `%ProgramFiles%\TrustedQSL\tqsl.exe`
- **macOS:** `/Applications/TrustedQSL/…`
- **Linux:** `/usr/bin/tqsl`, `/usr/local/bin/tqsl`, `/opt/tqsl/bin/tqsl`

You must install TQSL from the ARRL separately. Nexus does not bundle TQSL or manage Callsign Certificates. Upload is blocked until `lotw_station_location` is configured in Settings.

**Confirmation reconciliation** matches LoTW records to your logged QSOs by call (case-insensitive) + band (case-insensitive) + mode class (CW / Phone / Digital — so FT8, MFSK, and TempoFast all match the same Digital slot) + UTC day with ±1 day tolerance for midnight-boundary clock skew between the two operators. Reconcile only ever adds confirmation credit, never revokes it. Unmatched LoTW records are reported as OrphanConfirmation diagnostics.

## QRZ Integration

**Callbook autofill:** on every log-entry form, blurring the callsign field silently triggers a QRZ lookup. If the lookup returns data, it fills name, QTH, grid, state, and country into blank fields only — it never overwrites something you have typed. An explicit **Lookup** button beside the callsign triggers a non-silent lookup with a toast on failure (it asks QRZ first, then falls through to HamQTH).

QRZ lookup uses a session-key flow: Nexus logs in once and reuses the key for subsequent lookups without re-authenticating. Grid and state are subscriber-only on QRZ's free XML tier and will be `None` for non-subscribers; the UI toasts this limitation.

**QRZ Logbook push:** sends one ADIF record per QSO via HTTP POST to `https://logbook.qrz.com/api`. Push outcomes are classified: Ok/Replace → Accepted, Duplicate → Duplicate (benign), AUTH → AuthFail, FAIL + "duplicate" in the response body → Duplicate, other FAIL → Rejected. Every row in the Logbook table has a per-row push button (↥) for on-demand re-push.

The **Test** button in Settings calls the STATUS action against your API key, returning the owner callsign, logbook name, and QSO count without inserting anything.

Auto-push to QRZ Logbook on every new log entry is controlled by the `qrz_logbook_upload` setting (default: **off**).

---

## ClubLog Integration

ClubLog realtime push sends one ADIF record per QSO to `https://clublog.org/realtime.php`. Authentication uses your email address, an Application Password (not your main ClubLog account password), callsign, and a developer API key.

HTTP response codes determine outcome: 200 + body → Ok/Modified/Duplicate, 400 → Rejected, 403 → AuthFail, 5xx → ServerError (no stamp, retryable).

After a 403 (authentication suspended), Nexus sets a session-level flag that stops further auto-push attempts to avoid triggering ClubLog's IP-ban policy. Re-entering your credentials in Settings clears the flag.

Auto-push on log is controlled by `clublog_upload` (default: **off**). ClubLog integration requires a developer/app API key: official installer builds bundle one at build time, but it is never committed to the public GPLv3 repository — operators building from source must supply their own.

---

## eQSL Integration

**Outbound push:** one QSO is POSTed to `https://www.eqsl.cc/qslcard/ImportADIF.cfm`. Credentials travel inside the ADIF payload as `EQSL_USER`/`EQSL_PSWD` header tags, not as form fields. Responses are classified by text markers: "N out of M records added" (N > 0 → Accepted, N = 0 → Rejected), "duplicate" → Duplicate, credential errors → AuthFail, "system is down" → None (retryable, no stamp).

**InBox import (inbound confirmation sync):** a two-step HTTP flow:
1. Fetch the `DownloadInBox.cfm` HTML, confirm the "Your ADIF log file has been built" marker, and extract the `.adi` download link.
2. Fetch the `.adi` file; validate it starts with `ADIF`, contains "eqsl.cc DownloadInBox", includes `<eoh>`, and ends with `<eor>` (truncation detection). All URLs are forced to HTTPS and pinned to `*.eqsl.cc` to prevent a compromised redirect from substituting a forged confirmation payload.

The incremental cursor is a `YYYYMMDDHHMM` timestamp (RcvdSince), floored to the minute. A fresh install performs a full InBox pull on first sync.

Remember: eQSL sets `confirmed=true` but `award_confirmed=false`. InBox contacts appear in your confirmation panel but do not advance DXCC or other award-body-gated counts.

Auto-push to eQSL on log is controlled by `eqsl_upload` (default: **off**).

---

## HRDLog.net Integration

HRDLog.net realtime push sends one QSO to the `NewEntry.aspx` robot endpoint after each log entry. Authentication uses your callsign plus an HRDLog upload code (not your account password), stored in the OS keychain.

Responses are classified into the same Accepted / Duplicate / AuthFail / Rejected outcomes and written to the shared connection event log. Unlike the other connectors, HRDLog does not stamp a per-QSO ADIF upload-state field, so its push state is not carried in the exported ADIF.

Auto-push to HRDLog on log is controlled by `hrdlog_upload` (default: **off**).

---

## Keychain Credential Policy

All connector credentials — LoTW, eQSL, QRZ XML password, QRZ Logbook API key, ClubLog Application Password, and the HRDLog upload code — are stored in the OS keychain:

| Platform | Keychain |
|---|---|
| Windows | Credential Manager |
| macOS | Keychain |
| Linux | Secret Service (libsecret) |

Credentials are stored under the service name `tempo`. The UI receives only a boolean per connector indicating whether a credential is present; the secrets themselves are never returned to the frontend. All debug log output redacts passwords and session keys.

---

## Upload State Machine

Every QSO record carries a per-source `UploadOutcome` stamped at upload time and persisted in `APP_TEMPO_UL_*` ADIF app-fields:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Pending | Submitted to TQSL / sent to endpoint; awaiting partner action |
| Accepted | Partner confirmed receipt |
| Duplicate | Already present at the service (benign) |
| Rejected | Service refused the record; inspect the connection event log |
| AuthFail | Credentials invalid; re-enter in Settings |

The connection event log (accessible from Settings → Logging & Connectors ▸ Connections) holds the last 200 events in a rolling buffer, covering every credential save, sync download, upload dispatch, and service rejection for all five connectors. Each event carries a timestamp, connector name, severity, and a sanitized message (absolute paths redacted to basenames, truncated to 200 characters).

A per-row push button (↥) in the Logbook table lets you re-push any individual QSO to QRZ on demand without re-syncing the entire log. ClubLog and eQSL have no per-row push button; re-uploading to those services requires triggering a full sync.

---

## Prior-QSO History

As you type a callsign in the CW or Phone cockpit log strip, the prior-QSO history panel updates in real time showing:

- **B4 chip** — worked before (any band/mode)
- **Dupe on current band** — same call, same band, today
- Total prior QSO count and last contact date
- Distinct bands worked (e.g., "20m/40m/15m")
- Distinct modes worked
- Confirmed count

This is the same B4 chip that appears on decode rows in the FT8 cockpit. The history panel is not present in the FT8 cockpit or the standalone Logbook form; those surfaces draw from the same logbook query but do not display the full history panel.

---

## Journey: Gamified Progress Tracking

Journey is a fully shipped, local-only progress layer that runs entirely against your logbook — no accounts, no network, no data leaves the app.

The Journey view includes:

- **Level / XP** — a spine that advances with every new contact
- **Firsts** — auto-detected moments named with heritage context: first DX, first CW, first park, first gray-line QSO, first QRP contact
- **Ladders** — tiered rungs toward official awards (DXCC milestones, WAZ zones, WAS states, band/mode certificates)
- **Collections** — fill-the-map boards for continents, band × mode combinations, and CQ zones
- **Feats** — novel accomplishments: QRP, miles-per-watt personal best, gray-line timing, POTA/SOTA milestones
- **Personal bests** — furthest contact, highest SNR worked, most QSOs in a day
- **Streak** — opt-in weekly operating streak (controlled by the `journey_streak_enabled` setting; off by default)

Journey processes an imported log immediately on import, so bringing in an existing ADIF file from another logger lights up your Firsts and Ladders instantly.

Journey is deliberately white-hat: there are no decaying streaks (the streak widget is opt-in), no FOMO mechanics, and no public leaderboard.

---

## Limits / Not Yet

- **Unmodelled ADIF fields ride along, but are not displayed.** COUNTY, contest exchanges and QSL dates survive import/export verbatim; they have no UI of their own yet.
- **LoTW upload requires a separately installed TQSL** (from the ARRL). Nexus does not bundle TQSL or handle Callsign Certificate management.
- **QRZ grid and state** are subscriber-only on the free QRZ XML tier and will be absent for non-subscribers.
- **ClubLog developer API key** is baked into official installer builds but never committed to the public GPLv3 source. Operators building from source must supply their own key via the build environment or Settings.
- **eQSL InBox download** is a page-scrape that depends on the "Your ADIF log file has been built" HTML marker. A change in eQSL's page structure will break the extractor until an update ships.
- **Background timers are opt-in and few.** LoTW, eQSL, QRZ, and ClubLog syncs are triggered manually or on log entry (for outbound auto-push). The two exceptions are both off by default and both switched on in Settings: the QRZ delta pull (**Pull confirmations automatically**) and the LoTW batch upload (**Upload to LoTW automatically**). There is no automatic scheduled pull for eQSL or ClubLog.
- **WAZ** does not advance for contacts whose callsign cannot be resolved to a DXCC entity by cty.dat.
- **No IOTA, WWFF, or Worked-All-Grids award tracking** in the current awards engine.
- **Journey streak** is opt-in; the widget is hidden until you enable `journey_streak_enabled` in Settings.
- **Desktop-only** (Tauri v2). No mobile or web-based logbook sync path.
