## WSJT-X UDP Protocol

Nexus implements the full WSJT-X UDP datagram protocol on port `2237`. It is both a producer and a consumer on the same socket — connect any downstream tool that expects a live WSJT-X source.

### Outbound datagrams (Nexus → logger / overlay)

| Type | Number | Sent when |
|---|---|---|
| Heartbeat | 0 | Periodic keepalive |
| Status | 1 | Every decode cycle, band/mode/TX state |
| Decode | 2 | Each decoded callsign |
| QsoLogged | 5 | Immediately after each auto-logged QSO |

Type numbers are pinned to the canonical WSJT-X 0–15 range. A prior +1 offset in an earlier build was corrupting JTAlert FreeText as HaltTx; that bug is resolved.

When Field Day mode is active, the Status datagram sets `special_op = 3` so JTAlert and GridTracker automatically activate their Field Day operating behavior without any extra configuration.

### Inbound datagrams (logger / overlay → Nexus)

Nexus accepts and acts on:

| Message | Effect |
|---|---|
| HaltTx | Stops TX immediately (same as `Esc`) |
| Clear | Clears the Band Activity pane |
| Replay | Re-emits decode history |
| Location | Updates the operator grid |
| HighlightCallsign | Applies bg/fg color to a row; shown inline as JTAlert highlight |
| FreeText | When `send=true` and text is non-empty, immediately queues an open broadcast via the TempoFast engine. When `send=false` or text is empty, no action is taken. |
| Reply | Double-click equivalent — arms the sequencer for the named decode |

### JTAlert and GridTracker

JTAlert connects to port `2237` exactly as it would to WSJT-X. Highlight colors sent via `HighlightCallsign` appear on decode rows as inline background/foreground style overrides with no additional configuration. GridTracker receives Decode and Status datagrams and can drive Nexus via Reply.

To reach a logger on a different machine, change `wsjtx_udp` in Settings from `127.0.0.1:2237` to the logger's IP. Nexus sends to that address and binds its inbound receive on an OS-assigned ephemeral port (`0.0.0.0:0`), not on a fixed port 2237. Inbound control datagrams from JTAlert/GridTracker are received on that ephemeral port (the source port of Nexus's outgoing packets).

---

## Companion Mode

Companion mode lets Nexus ride a running WSJT-X, JTDX, or MSHV decode stream over UDP port `2237` instead of driving its own soundcard decoder. The upstream source still runs the radio; Nexus ingests its Decode datagrams, applies its own DXCC/award annotations, drives the sequencer, and logs QSOs.

Enable it with the **Source** toggle in the Operate cockpit header (Native / Companion).

Companion-mode limitations to know:
- `F6` / Redecode is a silent no-op in Companion mode. The function is guarded to avoid draining live UDP datagrams from the upstream source.
- The early decode pass (t≈11.8 s into an FT8 period in native mode) does not apply; decodes arrive at whatever cadence the upstream source sends them.
- Split Operation and PTT are still commanded through Nexus's own CAT path; the upstream source and Nexus must not both hold the rig simultaneously unless the CAT broker is enabled.

---

## CAT Broker (Share the Rig)

The CAT broker exposes Nexus's internal rigctld connection as a secondary TCP server so another application — WSJT-X, N1MM, HRD — can share the same rig without a hardware splitter or a second CAT cable.

The broker is **off by default**. Turn it on with **Share this radio with other programs**, under **Settings › Radio › Transmit limits & sharing**. The port it listens on is a separate control — **Sharing port**, under **Settings › Radio › Rig & CAT** — and it defaults to `4532`, matching the Hamlib NET rigctl default; change it only if something else on the machine already owns that port. Both Nexus and the attached client see consistent VFO, mode, and PTT state through the same serialized Hamlib session.

Commands served: frequency read/set (`f`/`F`), mode read/set (`m`/`M`), PTT read/set (`t`/`T`), VFO read/set (`v`/`V`), split query (`s`), plus `\dump_state`, `\chk_vfo`, `\get_powerstat`, and `q`. An `L RFPOWER` command returns `RPRT -11` (not implemented). The broker does not multiplex PTT — if WSJT-X and Nexus both attempt TX simultaneously, the last-write wins. Coordinate TX scheduling at the application level (e.g. use Companion mode so only one app is transmitting).

---

## N3FJP Field Day Push

During a Field Day session, Nexus pushes each newly logged QSO to N3FJP over TCP using the documented N3FJP API (ADDDIRECT + CHECKLOG). The push is fire-and-forget from a spawned thread so a slow or parked N3FJP host never stalls the decode loop.

**Default port: 1100** (N3FJP's documented API default). Configure host and port in **Settings › Logging & Connectors › N3FJP Integration**.

The **Test N3FJP** button in Settings sends the `<CMD><PROGRAM></CMD>` handshake and returns the program name and version string (e.g. `N3FJP Field Day Contest Log v6.6`). It is disabled when the host field is blank.

Prerequisites:
- N3FJP must have its TCP API enabled: **Settings › Application Program Interface** inside N3FJP.
- N3FJP must be reachable on the LAN at the configured host and port.
- Push errors are written to stderr; they are not surfaced in the UI beyond the Test button result. Check N3FJP's API log if contacts are not appearing.

This path replaces the WSJT-X → JTAlert → N3FJP bridge entirely. No JTAlert license is required.

---

## N1MM+ contactinfo Broadcast

Each new Field Day QSO emits an N1MM-format `<contactinfo>` XML datagram. N1MM dashboards and GridTracker see Nexus as a first-class network station.

**Default port: 12060.** Set the destination address in **Settings › Logging & Connectors › N1MM+ Integration**. If you specify a host with no port (e.g. `192.168.1.50`), Nexus appends `:12060` automatically.

The datagram carries: `mycall`, `call`, `band`, `mode`, `timestamp`, `section`, `points`, `contestname`, `rxfreq`/`txfreq` (in 10 Hz units), the sent exchange, and a 32-hex per-QSO dedup ID. Nexus sends only; it does not receive or aggregate inbound N1MM contactinfo from other stations.

---

## DX Cluster / RBN

Nexus connects to a human DX-cluster node via a standard telnet session; the RBN CW and digital skimmer feeds are wired in automatically alongside it.

**Default host: `ve7cc.net:23`** (the CC-Cluster community node, which carries human-posted spots including SSB/phone), with `dxc.wa9pie.net:8000` as a fallback. Change it in **Settings › Logging & Connectors › Integrations & Feeds** to reach a private cluster or a regional node. The RBN CW/digital skimmer feeds (`reversebeacon.net:7000` / `:7001`) are auto-wired separately and should **not** be entered as the Cluster Host — the RBN skimmer network carries no human SSB/phone spots, so pointing the Cluster Host at it empties the Phone rows of the Needed board.

Spots admitted to the Needed board must be within 900 seconds old (15 minutes). The spot buffer holds 200 spots by default; high-activity periods can push older spots out faster than the admission window.

On VHF bands (6 m / 4 m / 2 m), Nexus applies a locality gate: a cluster spot is only admitted if the skimmer is within 250 km of your grid square. A Florida RBN skimmer hearing a 6 m Es opening does not populate the band ladder for a Wisconsin operator. (The 800 km figure is `REGION_RADIUS_KM`, which governs the PSK Reporter near-region MQTT feed — a separate concept.)

The cluster feed is used by:
- The **Needed board** (CW and Phone rows; digital rows come from PSK Reporter decodes)
- The **Connect map** live spot dots
- **Click-to-work** split detection — if the spot comment contains `UP N`, `DN N`, `UP N.N`, or `QSX <freq>`, Nexus parses the pile-up offset and applies it atomically at click-to-work time so your TX lands where the DX is listening

Cluster feed status appears in the **Now-Bar** liveness pill (Live / Connected / Connecting / Reconnecting / Idle), distinguishing a normal quiet-band lull from an actual connection problem.

## PSK Reporter

Nexus sends spots to PSK Reporter and consumes reception data from it through two parallel paths.

### Outbound spotting

Decoded callsigns are batched and flushed to PSK Reporter at most every **300 seconds** (`PSK_FLUSH_SECS`). Early-pass decodes (t≈11.8 s into an FT8 period in native mode) reach PSK Reporter at the same moment they reach the UI via the shared emit path — no separate spot-submission delay.

### Inbound reception data (MQTT + HTTP)

| Path | Details |
|---|---|
| MQTT firehose | `mqtt.pskreporter.info:1883`; two operator-specific topic filters (who hears you / who you hear); 20,000-spot ring buffer |
| HTTP query | Rate-limited to ≥5 min between fetches; 300 s nowcast TTL; returns historical reception data |
| Near-region MQTT | Band-wide topics for 10 m / 6 m / 4 m / 2 m; 60,000-spot ring buffer; spots filtered to within 800 km of your grid |

Both paths feed the same spot window before the opening detector and band advisor run. The Now-Bar PSKR liveness pill tracks feed freshness with a 900-second window.

PSK Reporter data drives:
- The **Needed board** near-me and getting-out evidence
- The **Getting Out** panel (distinct receiver count, furthest reception, named receivers with direction and SNR)
- The **BAND OPEN** annotation in the POTA/SOTA hunter view
- The **opening detector** anomaly engine

The PSKR feed requires your callsign to be configured (3–10 characters, at least one letter and one digit). Without a callsign no live spots are fetched.

## Online-Service Connectors

All connector credentials live exclusively in the OS keychain (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) under service name `tempo`. Credential presence is exposed to the UI as a boolean per connector; the secrets themselves are never returned to any UI component.

| Service | What it does | Default | Auth | Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LoTW** | Upload via TQSL; incremental confirmation download | Off (requires `lotw_username`) | TQSL certificate | See [Logbook and Awards](Logbook-and-Awards.md) |
| **QRZ Logbook** | Per-QSO push on log; callbook autofill on call-field blur | Off (`qrz_logbook_upload: false`) | XML session key + Logbook API key | See [Logbook and Awards](Logbook-and-Awards.md) |
| **ClubLog** | Realtime per-QSO push; auto-suspends on 403 to avoid IP-ban | Off (`clublog_upload: false`) | Application Password (not main password) | See [Logbook and Awards](Logbook-and-Awards.md) |
| **eQSL** | Outbound push per-QSO; InBox download for confirmation sync | Off (`eqsl_upload: false`) | eQSL username + password | See [Logbook and Awards](Logbook-and-Awards.md) |
| **World Radio League** | Per-QSO push on log; per-row push from the Logbook; Export for WRL for bulk backfill | Off (`wrl_upload: false`) | WRL API key (verified against your account at save; logbook resolved automatically) | See [Logbook and Awards](Logbook-and-Awards.md) |

Auto-push on log (QRZ / ClubLog / eQSL / WRL) is controlled by per-service boolean settings flags. All three default off — you opt in per-service. LoTW upload is always manual (TQSL must be invoked by the operator or via the Upload button in the Awards view).

An important confirmation-source distinction: eQSL confirmations set `confirmed = true` but `award_confirmed = false`. Only LoTW and paper QSL confirmations set `award_confirmed = true`. All award counting — DXCC, WAZ, WAS, Honor Roll — uses `award_confirmed` exclusively, so eQSL-only contacts are never over-counted toward official credit. See [Logbook and Awards](Logbook-and-Awards.md) for the full awards and connector reference.

## Limits / Not Yet

- The CAT broker does not multiplex PTT; simultaneous TX from two applications is not guarded — coordinate at the application level.
- N1MM integration is broadcast-only; Nexus does not receive inbound contactinfo from other network stations.
- N3FJP push errors are not surfaced in the UI beyond the Test button; check N3FJP's API log for delivery failures.
- The PSK Reporter HTTP query path is rate-limited to ≥5 minutes between fetches to respect PSK Reporter's published query policy; the MQTT firehose is the real-time path.
- ClubLog integration requires a developer API key (`CLUBLOG_API_KEY`): official installers bundle one at build time, but it is never committed to the public GPLv3 repository — operators building from source must supply their own key.
- LoTW upload requires the operator's own installed TQSL binary from ARRL; Nexus does not bundle TQSL or handle Callsign Certificate management.
- eQSL InBox download uses an HTML scrape of the DownloadInBox page; a page-structure change at eQSL would break the extractor.
- There is no background periodic sync for any online service; the operator must trigger downloads manually or enable per-QSO auto-push.
- Desktop-only (Tauri v2); no mobile or web client.
