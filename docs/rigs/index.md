# Rig Setup Guides

Nexus talks to your radio through **Hamlib** — the same CAT library WSJT-X uses.
The Windows installer bundles it, so CAT and rotor control work offline out of the
box with nothing else to install. Around fifty rigs are curated into the model
picker; the definitive list for your installed Hamlib version is always
`rigctl -l`.

> **Where Hamlib comes from depends on the platform.** The bundled `rigctld` (and
> rotator daemon) ship in the Windows installer only. Linux and Raspberry Pi use
> the system Hamlib instead: the `.deb` pulls `libhamlib-utils` in for you, and
> AppImage users run `sudo apt install libhamlib-utils` once. Either way Nexus
> never transmits on launch — TX is always an explicit operator action, and a
> declared license class is enforced as a real Part 97 sub-band lockout.

## Pick your brand

| Brand | Guide | Field status |
|---|---|---|
| **Yaesu** | [yaesu.md](yaesu.md) | Verified on FTDX10 and FT-991A |
| **Icom** | [icom.md](icom.md) | IC-9700 incl. 23 cm; IC-7300-class single-USB |
| **FlexRadio** | [flexradio.md](flexradio.md) | LAN discovery verified on a FLEX-6400M; CAT chain in final verification |
| **Xiegu** | [xiegu.md](xiegu.md) | Supported but **not yet field-verified** |
| **Sound-card interfaces** | [interfaces.md](interfaces.md) | Digirig / RIGblaster; **not yet field-verified** |
| **Rotators** | [rotators.md](rotators.md) | Dummy-verified; real az/el hardware pending |

Kenwood, Elecraft, Ten-Tec, QRP Labs, and Alinco are also in the curated model
picker and follow the generic serial path below — they just don't have a
brand-specific page yet. If you run one and want notes added, open an issue.

## The two connection types

Everything in **Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Rig & CAT** comes down to one choice — the
**Connection** dropdown:

### Serial (USB / COM) — most rigs

This is the default and covers nearly every radio, including all Yaesu, Icom,
Kenwood, Elecraft, and Xiegu models. You set three things:

1. **Rig Model** — pick your radio from the dropdown (it shows the Hamlib model
   number in parentheses).
2. **Serial Port** — the COM port (Windows) or tty device (Linux/macOS) that
   carries CAT. Use **Refresh** to re-scan, or **Auto-test** to have Nexus probe
   each port read-only (it never transmits) and select the one that actually
   drives your rig.
3. **Baud** — match whatever your rig's CAT menu is set to. Nexus defaults to
   **38400**; set the rig and Nexus to the same value.

The fastest way to fill all three is **Detect my radio** (the *Zero-config
setup* button): one scan reads your USB devices, fills the model, port, and
paired sound device, and — if Windows is missing a USB-serial driver — shows the
exact download link. Review what it filled, then **Save**.

### Network (FlexRadio / remote)

Choose this for a **FlexRadio** driven through SmartSDR CAT, or for any rig
served by a **remote `rigctld`** over TCP. You set a single **Network Address**
as `host:port` — for a Flex that's `127.0.0.1:5002`. See the
[FlexRadio guide](flexradio.md) for the full picture.

## Confirming it works: Test CAT

After you Save, click **Test CAT**. It saves your settings, launches the bundled
`rigctld`, and reads your rig's dial frequency back. A result like
`✓ 14.074 MHz` means the port opened, the model is right, and the rig answered.
An `RPRT` error or timeout points at a wrong model, wrong baud, wrong port, or
another app holding the port. Test CAT mirrors the WSJT-X "Test CAT" workflow —
run it any time you change model, port, or baud.

## My rig isn't listed

The picker is curated to ~50 common radios, not the whole Hamlib catalog. If
yours isn't there, the way in is an external `rigctld`:

- **Talk to an external `rigctld` (NET rigctl, model 2).** Run `rigctld`
  yourself for your rig — `rigctl -l` lists every model number your installed
  Hamlib knows, so you can launch the daemon with the exact one — then in Nexus
  select **NET rigctl (remote rigctld)**, set **Connection ▸ Network**, and
  point the Network Address at that daemon's `host:port`. Nexus becomes just
  another Hamlib network client.

The picker also always includes two Hamlib pseudo-rigs: **Dummy** (model 1) for
click-through testing with no hardware, and **FLRig** (model 4) to route through
an flrig instance.
