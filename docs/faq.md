# Nexus FAQ

Answers for new operators and for hams evaluating Nexus against the tools they
already run. **Nexus left beta at 1.0.0**: the FT8/FT4 core is production-grade
and verified against WSJT-X behavior, and where a number still comes from the bench
rather than the air these answers say so. Field reports are still what closes those
gaps.

---

## Operating and modes

### Is this a WSJT-X replacement?

For **FT8 and FT4 operating**, that is the goal. The sequencer is built to WSJT-X's
behavior and verified against a 207-row parity matrix, and Nexus adds things stock
WSJT-X doesn't have — country and worked-before flags on every decode, one-click
"work it" that jumps band/mode/frequency together, and a Needed board that ranks the
stations on the air by what they are worth to *your* log.

Nexus now transmits and receives **Q65, FST4, FST4W, MSK144, JT65 and WSPR** as well, so
the mode gap has largely closed. And
Nexus speaks WSJT-X's UDP protocol, so you don't have to choose all-or-nothing — your
GridTracker/JTAlert/logger workflow survives either way. See [interop.md](interop.md).

### What is TempoFast, in one sentence?

FT8's message set on a 4-second cycle with cellular-style retransmission combining —
keyboard chat at conversation speed, still down in the weak-signal noise. It works on
the air; the published threshold figures are still bench numbers. The longer story is in
[protocols/tempofast.md](protocols/tempofast.md).

### Is TempoFast more sensitive than FT8?

**No — and this is the most important thing to understand about it.** TempoFast trades
roughly 6 dB of raw single-shot sensitivity against FT8 (about 2.5 dB against FT4)
for a nearly 4× faster cycle plus an IR-HARQ path that lets weak retransmissions
combine instead of being wasted. FT8's ~−21 dB threshold is the most sensitive here;
TempoFast's ~−15 dB sits about where FT4 does. Those numbers are **bench figures
only.** If you want maximum reach in
one shot, use FT8; if you want a conversation, use TempoFast. When the path is fading, use
[TempoDeep](protocols/tempodeep.md).

### What is TempoDeep?

The robust tier: non-coherent 8-FSK on a 15-second cycle, built to shrug off the
fading that collapses coherent modes (a ~3.7 dB fading penalty in simulation, where
coherent modes lose 10+ dB). It gives up some raw sensitivity to stay decodable on
NVIS, polar, and rough paths. Details in [protocols/tempodeep.md](protocols/tempodeep.md).

### Are the TempoFast/TempoDeep performance numbers proven?

The modes work on the air: first TempoFast decode 2026-07-21, first two-station QSO
on 6 m 2026-07-26. The **numbers** come from AWGN and Rayleigh-fading bench sweeps,
re-checked in the test suite and the Windows cross-build, rather than from the air.
Decode-rate-versus-SNR on real bands is the project's #1 remaining gate, and on-air
reports are what close it. Every dB figure Nexus publishes is labeled "simulated" for
exactly this reason.

### How do I help close that gap?

Send honest on-air reports: band, dial frequency, which tier (TempoFast or TempoDeep), distance
and rough conditions, and what you decoded versus what you expected — including the
surprises (false decodes, retransmissions that combined, stations you saw that others
didn't). Field reports are the single most useful contribution right now. Use the
issue tracker at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/nexus-ham-radio>.

One thing worth checking before you try: read the clock in the top bar at **both**
ends. A few tenths of a second of UTC error is invisible on FT8 and is fatal to
Tempo.

## Setup and safety

### Do I need to install Hamlib, WebView2, or drivers first?

On **Windows**, no. Hamlib (for CAT and rotator control) and the WebView2 runtime are
**bundled** in the installer, so Nexus works on a bare PC with no separate installs.
If Windows is missing a USB bridge-chip driver for your rig's interface, the
first-run wizard detects that and gives you the right download link.

On **Linux and the Raspberry Pi**, CAT uses the system Hamlib instead of a bundled
copy: the `.deb` pulls `libhamlib-utils` in automatically, and AppImage users run
`sudo apt install libhamlib-utils` once.

On **macOS**, CAT needs Hamlib's tools from Homebrew: `brew install hamlib` in
Terminal, then restart Nexus. (Homebrew itself is at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).)
WSJT-X or your logger working without it proves only the Hamlib *library* is
present — Nexus drives the radio through the `rigctld` *program*, a separate
package those apps don't use.

### Will Nexus transmit on its own?

**Never on launch.** Nexus starts passive — it listens. Every transmission is an
explicit operator action (you send a message, answer, or call CQ). On top of that
there is a transmit watchdog and a **license-class lockout** (Technician / General /
Extra per Part 97, including the 2026 60 m rules) that blocks every transmit path in
software outside your privileges. The presence beacon is off by default.

### About 50 rigs are "supported" — is mine one?

Around 50 rigs are curated out of the box (Icom including the IC-9700 and IC-705;
Yaesu FTDX10, FT-991A, FT-710; Kenwood; Elecraft; FlexRadio; Xiegu; QRP Labs QMX and
more), and Hamlib is bundled, so CAT and rotator control work offline. "Detect my
radio" scans USB and finds FlexRadios on the LAN, then fills in the model, port, and
paired audio in one click.

**Field-verified so far:** the Yaesu FTDX10 and FT-991A, and native-CI-V Icom, where the
IC-9700's own spectrum scope streams into the cockpit as a real panadapter — all on real
hardware. Other rigs use Hamlib's well-established support but have not each been
bench-verified in Nexus specifically, so confirming your particular rig is useful feedback
whatever the version number says.

### What's the story with FlexRadio and Xiegu?

Both work today over **Hamlib CAT** — Flex via SmartSDR's network CAT, Xiegu over
serial — and Flex is discoverable on the LAN with one-click DAX audio pairing. Honest
status:

- **FlexRadio:** there are two paths. Hamlib network CAT is the default and is the
  verified one, on a FLEX-6400M. The **native SmartSDR path** — the SmartSDR panadapter,
  DAX RX and TX audio and the rig's native meters over VITA-49 — ships, and it keeps
  working under Remote Desktop where the DAX sound devices are invisible. It is
  **opt-in, off by default, and not yet confirmed on hardware here**; turn it back off
  if decodes stop.
- **Xiegu:** supported via Hamlib CAT (e.g. the G90), but **not yet verified on
  hardware** in Nexus. If you run one, a field report is welcome.

### Why is the download about 210 MB?

Because everything is bundled: the WebView2 runtime, Hamlib (CAT + rotator), and the
whole DSP stack. That is the tradeoff for working offline on a bare PC with no
separate installs and no admin rights — a per-user install that just runs.

### Why does the installer warn that it's unsigned?

Nexus ships **unsigned** today, so Windows SmartScreen will show a warning when you
run the installer. This is what an unsigned build from an individual developer looks
like — code-signing certificates are a paid, identity-verified process, and 1.0 does not
change that. To install safely,
**verify the SHA-256 hash** of the download against the value published on the release
page before running it. Click "More info → Run anyway" once the hash matches.

## Data, licensing, and platforms

### Where does my data go?

Your log stays **local**, in an ADIF file on your machine. Uploads happen **only** to
the services you explicitly configure — LoTW, QRZ, ClubLog, eQSL, HRDLog.net — and
those credentials live in the **OS keychain** (Windows Credential Manager, the macOS
Keychain, or the Secret Service keyring on Linux and the Pi), never in a plaintext
config file.
Journey/achievement progress never leaves your computer. Nexus has no telemetry or
analytics phone-home; the only outbound traffic is the connectors you turn on and, by
default, PSK Reporter spot uploads (which you can disable).

### Is Nexus really free? What's the license?

Yes — Nexus is **free and open source under the GPL-3.0.** There is no paid tier, no
subscription, and no "pro" upsell. The GPL means you get the complete source, you can
study and modify it, and any distributed derivative must also be GPL-3.0. Nexus builds
on WSJT-X's GPL heritage (the 77-bit message packing, LDPC FEC, and FFTW
infrastructure), which is why the shared message layer is compatible with the modes
you already run.

### Where is the source code, and can I contribute?

The repository is <https://sourceforge.net/projects/nexus-ham-radio>. Contributions are welcome —
issues, field reports, and pull requests all help. The most valuable ones are **on-air
decode reports** for TempoFast and TempoDeep (see "How do I help close that gap?" above)
and **rig confirmations** for radios beyond the ones the author has bench-verified. Bugs,
propagation-model feedback, and interop reports against your particular logger or cluster
are all useful.

### Mac or Linux?

**Linux ships**, as `Nexus_<version>_pc_amd64.deb` and `Nexus_<version>_amd64.AppImage`,
and 64-bit **Raspberry Pi OS** on a Pi 3, 4 or 5 gets its own `.deb` per base —
`Nexus_<version>_pi_arm64_bookworm.deb` and `Nexus_<version>_pi_arm64_trixie.deb`. All
platforms build from the same tree and ship together every release. CAT on Linux
uses the system Hamlib rather than a bundled copy; the `.deb` pulls `libhamlib-utils` in
for you and AppImage users run `sudo apt install libhamlib-utils` once. On a slower Pi,
**Settings ▸ Digital ▸ Decode depth ▸ Fast** keeps FT8 and FT4 decoding in real time.

**macOS ships too, since 1.5.0**, as `Nexus_<version>_aarch64.dmg` for Apple Silicon
(M-series, macOS 12 or later) — signed and notarized, so Gatekeeper opens it without a
warning, and it self-updates like the Windows build. CAT needs Hamlib from Homebrew
(`brew install hamlib` — see "Do I need to install Hamlib…?" above). Intel Macs are
source-build only.

### Will there be automatic updates?

They already work. A new version downloads quietly in the background and then offers to
install. Nothing installs behind your back and nothing happens on a schedule: the button
waits for you, and it stands down while you are transmitting, tuning, in a contact or
running CQ, and tells you which. Every update is signed and verified before it is applied,
and an altered installer is refused. Windows, macOS and the Linux AppImage update in
place; the `.deb` packages, both Raspberry Pi ones included, are managed by your package
system and notify you instead.
