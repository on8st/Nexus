/// trailing zeros is the entire budget available to shift into.
/// FT1's slot lead-in — the ONLY early-timing margin the mode has, and half of a fixed budget.
///
/// The buffer is 4.6432 s of room holding 3.5357 s of tones, so lead and post-tone tail come out
/// of one 464 ms allowance and trade one-for-one:
///
/// ```text
///   early tolerance = the lead          (the decoder's istart clamps at 0)
///   late tolerance  = ~900 ms - lead    (the coarse sweep's top)
///   post-tone tail  = 464 ms - lead     (what survives soundcard output latency)
/// ```
///
/// **0.300 s, chosen on measurement (`crates/tempo-fast/tests/ft1_lead_sweep.rs`, operator
/// decision 2026-08-05).** It was 0.400 s, which left a 64 ms tail — and because the PTT hold is
/// clamped to the slot boundary and the device output ring lags the buffer by the soundcard's
/// latency, ANY output latency above ~64 ms cut FT1's RF mid-tone. 20-100 ms cpal buffers are
/// ordinary, so the shipped value was inside the failure region on real hardware.
///
/// The sweep (12 trials/cell, AWGN, -4/-8/-12 dB) shows early tolerance tracks the lead to the
/// millisecond and is a CLIFF, not a slope — flat at 10-12/12 up to -lead, then 0 at the next step
/// out, because `tempofast_decode.f90` cannot search before sample 0. The shape is identical at
/// all three SNRs, so it is timing and not sensitivity:
///
/// ```text
///   lead  tail |  -450 -400 -350 -300 -250 -200 -150  -100    0  +100  +250  +400
