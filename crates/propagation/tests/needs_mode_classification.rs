//! Regression cover for the false "new mode on 30m" field report (operator, 2026-07-29).
//!
//! The operator runs a ~11,200-QSO log that is overwhelmingly FT8 and HAS worked
//! Asiatic Russia on 30m — yet the Needed system claimed a new mode there. The
//! fixtures below are the operator's REAL stored rows (call / band / mode exactly as
//! they sit in `log.adi`, mixed-case band labels and all), so the matrix is exercised
//! against the data that produced the report rather than against tidied-up values.
//!
//! Two distinct defects are pinned here:
//!   1. the mode-class table missed real-world ADIF phone tokens (`PH`), so phone
//!      QSOs credited the DIGITAL slot and left a phantom Phone need behind;
//!   2. the NewMode headline named a BAND while the predicate behind it is
//!      entity-wide, which is how a true "never on CW" need read as a false claim
//!      about 30m to an operator who has worked that entity on 30m FT8.
//!
//! A full tag census over all 11,207 rows of that log also rules two suspects OUT,
//! which is why nothing here tests them: `SUBMODE` appears in ZERO records (FT4 is
//! stored as a bare `MODE=FT4`, so the MFSK+SUBMODE=FT4 collapse cannot be the
//! mechanism for this operator), and `DXCC` appears in ZERO records — the entity
//! travels only as the free-text `COUNTRY` string, which the backend ignores in favour
//! of resolving the callsign through cty.dat. The 13 tags actually present are CALL,
//! COUNTRY, BAND, FREQ, MODE, QSO_DATE, TIME_ON, GRIDSQUARE, NAME, RST_*, QTH, STATE,
//! LOTW_QSL_RCVD (+ APP_* upload state).
