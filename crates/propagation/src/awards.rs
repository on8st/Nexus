//! Award progress computed from the operator's logbook — DXCC-first.
//!
//! Pure + offline: each worked call is resolved to a DXCC entity via the vendored
//! cty.dat ([`crate::dxcc`]); we tally distinct entities worked/confirmed, the
//! entity×band "DXCC Challenge" slots, a per-band breakdown (the elite DX
//! tracker's view), and the chase list of worked-but-unconfirmed entities.
//!
//! Online LoTW/eQSL/QRZ/ClubLog sync (which would flip a QSO's `confirmed`) is a
//! separate, later increment; this computes everything from what's already in the
//! log, so it is fully testable with no network.
