/// permanently the moment ANY thread panics while holding it, and every later
/// `.lock()` then returns `Err` forever — so a single panic anywhere in the modem
/// took out **every decode and every transmit for the rest of the session**, and did
/// it silently:
///
/// * on the decode worker the panic is swallowed by a `catch_unwind`, so the app
///   keeps running and the waterfall keeps painting while it has gone completely
///   deaf — one line on stderr is the only trace;
/// * on the radio loop it surfaces as the "RADIO ENGINE CRASHED" banner with dead
///   TX/RX until restart.
///
/// Recovering is the right call here specifically because of what this mutex
/// guards. It protects process-global Fortran state, and every guarded region is a
/// single FFI call with the argument checks done OUTSIDE the lock — so there is
/// almost nothing left that can panic under it, and if something does, the state is
/// no more suspect than the panic already made it. Weigh that against the
/// alternative, which is not "fail safe" but "the radio is dead until you notice and
/// restart". A stale decode is caught by the CRC; a deaf receiver is not caught by
