/// ```
///
/// Because `t2p` is slot-relative and `tx2` is clamped, **an upstream over can
/// never cross the boundary** however late keying starts. Ours was an ABSOLUTE
/// deadline `keyed + audio + tail` with no slot term, so keying latency — a
/// blocking CAT exchange can spend a full 700 ms deadline, 2500 ms on a slow
/// transport — converted directly into slot overrun.
///
/// FT8 and FT4 hide that: 12.64 s of audio in a 15 s slot and 5.04 s in 7.5 s
/// leave ~2.11 s and ~2.21 s of slack, more than any single CAT stall.
///
/// ⚠️ **FT1 HAS −250 ms, AND IS THEREFORE CLAMPED ON EVERY OVER, AT EVERY PHASE — INCLUDING ONE
/// KEYED EXACTLY ON THE BOUNDARY.** An earlier version of this doc said "214 ms", computed from
/// FT1's TONE length (99 symbols x 3000/7 samples = 3.5357 s). That is not what the deadline is
/// sized from. `tempo_fast::gen_wave` returns a FIXED NMAX = 48000-sample (4.0000 s) buffer —
/// tones plus trailing zeros, and `Ft1Mode::gen_wave` shifts the lead-in WITHIN it rather than
/// prepending, precisely to keep the length at 4.0000 s (crates/modes/src/mode.rs). The hold is
/// sized from `w.len()`, so the real arithmetic is 4.000 + 0.250 = 4.250 in a 4.000 s period.
/// FT1's effective post-tone tail is a fixed **64.2 ms** (tones end at 0.400 + 3.5357 = 3.9357 s;
/// the clamp drops PTT at 4.000 s).
///
/// **RESOLVED 2026-08-05 by shortening the LEAD, on the operator's decision.** At the former
/// 0.400 s lead the tail was 64 ms, and because the device output ring lags the buffer by the
/// soundcard's latency, any output latency above that cut FT1's RF mid-tone — inside the failure
/// region for ordinary 20-100 ms cpal buffers. The lead is now 0.300 s
/// (`FT1_LEAD_IN_SECS`, crates/modes/src/mode.rs) and the tail is **164 ms**.
///
/// Lead and tail come out of one 464 ms budget and trade one-for-one, so this cost 100 ms of
/// early-timing tolerance — measured as a hard cliff, not a slope, in
/// `crates/tempo-fast/tests/ft1_lead_sweep.rs`. FT1 still cannot have both a full lead and a full
/// 250 ms tail; 0.300/0.164 is the balance chosen, and the sweep is the instrument for revisiting
/// it. The clamp itself is unchanged and still fires on every FT1 over. The 4 s period is by design (operator,
/// 2026-08-04: "ft1 has a designed 4 sec timing… but it should still follow strict
/// wsjtx based aspects of the transmission"); the missing bound was the defect.
///

/// index so it cannot disagree with the instant it bounds — same arithmetic as

///
