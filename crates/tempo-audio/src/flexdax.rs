//! FlexRadio native DAX audio orchestrator (Phase 2) — behind the `device` feature.
//!
//! Native DAX audio: the rig's audio travels over the SAME VITA-49 UDP path as the panadapter, so
//! FT8/APRS/RTTY decode straight off the network instead of through the WDM-KS "DAX Audio RX"
//! soundcard device — which is invisible under Remote Desktop (the documented DAX-under-RDP
//! problem). Mirrors [`crate::flexspectrum`], with three threads:
//! - a **TCP control** thread ([`FlexCat`]) registers Nexus as a client, creates ONE `dax_rx`
//!   stream on channel 1 + binds the operating slice's audio to it, learns the stream's VITA id
//!   from its own create REPLY (never from another client's status — see [`dax_stream_is_ours`]),
//!   creates the `dax_tx` stream and routes the rig's transmit audio to it, keeps the session
//!   alive, and puts every one of those back on teardown;
//! - a **UDP audio** thread receives VITA-49 datagrams, filters to that stream id (mandatory — the
//!   `0x03E3` class is shared with plain remote audio), decodes ([`parse_dax_audio`]) to mono
//!   24 kHz, resamples to the 12 kHz modem rate, and appends to a ring the engine drains as its RX
//!   audio source; and
//! - a **TX pacer** thread that streams the modem's transmit audio to the radio in REAL TIME
//!   ([`DaxTxSender`]).
//!
//! ⚠️ BOTH DIRECTIONS — NOT "RX ONLY". This header claimed "RX ONLY — nothing here touches TX"
//! for as long as the opposite was shipped, and that stale sentence is what sent the 2026-08-17
//! Flex audit hunting a transmit bug that is in fact a deliberate decision. What actually happens
//! while `flex_native_audio` is on: RX audio arrives over DAX, AND the rig's transmit audio is
//! re-routed to our `dax_tx` stream (`transmit set dax=1`) — so the operator's microphone is
//! disconnected for as long as the feature is on, and the sound card carries no TX audio. That is
//! the OPERATOR RULING of 2026-07-26 (reaffirmed 2026-08-17), restated in full at the
//! `transmit set dax=1` call site: one toggle means native audio both ways. Teardown puts the mic
//! and the slice's own DAX routing back.
//!
//! Opt-in via `flex_native_audio`, OFF by default, and never yet exercised against a real Flex.
//! Only channel 1 is ever created (the "DAX starvation" gotcha: unused streams make the radio
//! round-robin audio across all of them, starving the active one).
