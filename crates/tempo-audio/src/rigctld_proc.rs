/// What a serial control line is held at for the whole session (`-C rts_state=…` /

///
/// **Why any of this exists.** A serial port's driver raises RTS and DTR when the port is
/// opened, and Hamlib does not put them back down except on a line it is itself keying: `rig.c`
/// `rig_open` lowers a line only in the `RIG_PTT_SERIAL_RTS` / `_DTR` arms ("Needed on Linux
/// because the serial port driver sets RTS/DTR on open — only need to address the PTT line as we
/// offer config parameters to control the other"); the `RIG_PTT_NONE` / `_RIG` / `_RIG_MICDATA`
/// arms `break` without touching a pin. Its own force-low pair in `serial.c` is commented out
/// ("This fails on Linux and MacOS with hardware flow control"). Nexus's PTT default is `vox`, so
/// we pass no `-P` and land on exactly that do-nothing arm — and an interface that keys on RTS is
/// then **keyed by the act of connecting, for the whole session**. Hamlib's own answer to this is
/// these two config parameters (`rts_state` / `dtr_state`, values `Unset`/`ON`/`OFF`,
/// `src/serial_cfg_params.h` + `src/conf.c` `frontend_set_conf`), applied by `iofunc.c`
/// `port_open` AFTER `serial_setup` has finished — which is why using them is not the upstream
/// bug re-created: that one forced the pins low BEFORE termios was configured.
///
/// **[`Low`](LineState::Low) is Nexus's default** and is the fix. [`High`](LineState::High) is
/// for an accessory that draws its supply from the line (Hamlib's own wording for these
/// parameters is "for external powering"): an RS-232-era homebrew CI-V level converter, a
/// K1EL-style serial keyer. [`Untouched`](LineState::Untouched) says nothing at all and is
/// exactly 1.0.1 behaviour — the recovery hatch, and the value every failure path falls back to.
/// WSJT-X ("Force Control Lines: DTR/RTS = High|Low|blank") and fldigi both expose the same
/// three-way per line; they default to leave-alone, Nexus defaults to Low.
///
/// **PLATFORMS — this is deliberately NOT `cfg(unix)`.** Hamlib implements these parameters on
/// every platform (`ser_set_rts`/`ser_set_dtr` are `TIOCMBIC` on POSIX and, through Hamlib's own
/// `win32_serial_ioctl`, `EscapeCommFunction(CLRRTS/CLRDTR)` on Windows — `lib/termios.c`), so
/// the flags do real work on Windows, which is where nearly every Nexus operator is.
///
/// What differs is only how much was already true there, and it is NOT the same for the two
/// lines. Hamlib's Windows `tcsetattr` sets `fDtrControl = DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE` itself
/// (`lib/termios.c:2727`), so DTR is already driven low at open; it never touches
/// `fRtsControl`, which keeps whatever `GetCommState` returned from the driver — and RTS is
/// exactly the line the field report is about. On Linux the tty driver raises both and Hamlib's
/// own force-low pair is commented out. So: DTR-low is a documented no-op on Windows, RTS-low
/// is not, and setting an already-low line low costs nothing anywhere. Scoping this to Unix
/// would withhold the fix from the platform that needs it most.

/// - A refused *combination* — a legal value on a line `rig_open` will not have — is silent:
///   `rig_open` returns `-RIG_ECONF` and rigctld does **not** exit on it ("continue even if
///   opening the rig fails, because it may be powered off"), so it goes on serving a rig it

/// - `-s <baud>` serial speed — omitted for a network rig (`network`) or an empty addr, since
///   a TCP rig has no baud rate.
/// - `-t <tcp_port>` TCP port for the daemon to listen on.
/// - `-P <RTS|DTR>` / `-p <addr>` ONLY when `ptt_line` is set: the daemon ALSO keys the

///   interface case (Digirig Mobile), where keying and control share one port and we
///   therefore cannot open the line ourselves — rigctld holds it.

///   when the PTT pathname is empty, then `if (!strcmp(pttp->pathname, rp->pathname))

///
///   ⚠️ The type token MUST be one Hamlib recognises — `RIG`, `DTR`, `RTS`, `PARALLEL`,
///   `NONE` (rigctld(1) of the bundled 4.7.x). Anything else does NOT error: rigctld prints
///   "Unrecognised PTT type, using NONE" and comes up with keying silently disabled, which
///   looks exactly like a dead rig. `ptt_type_token` is therefore derived from the enum, not
///   spelled at the call site, and is pinned by tests.
/// - `-C rts_state=…` / `-C dtr_state=…` per [`ControlLines`]: hold a control line at a fixed
///   level for the whole session, so opening the port cannot key the transmitter. `lines` must
///   already have been narrowed by [`resolve_lines`] to what this rig's Hamlib accepts — see
///   [`SettableLines`] for the two refusals and why a wrong flag is silently dead CAT.
/// - `-vvv` — **why the daemon says anything at all, and why it says the RIGHT thing.** rigctld
///   hands its `-v` count straight to `rig_set_debug`, so with no flag Hamlib runs at
///   `RIG_DEBUG_NONE` and prints NOTHING; the stderr pipe [`spawn_rigctld`] opens then drains an
///   empty stream, which is exactly how a failing FT-847 produced a support report saying
///   "nothing noteworthy". `-vv` is `RIG_DEBUG_ERR`, the first level that emits at all — but it
///   covers the OPEN (`serial_open: serial port COM99 does not exist`), and the commonest fault
///   behind that report is not an open: it is *the port opened and the rig never answered*, whose
///   explaining line is `RIG_DEBUG_WARN`. `-vvv` is that level, it costs nothing on a healthy rig
///   (measured: byte-identical output at `-vv` and `-vvv` over 10 serial polls and 30 network
///   polls that all succeeded), and `-vvvv` is where the per-transaction narration starts and is

/// port open and its TCP port bound, and the NEXT launch can land on it — the crossed-CAT
/// shape `is_alive` warns about.
///
/// Two bounded mechanisms, deliberately NOT a supervisor:
/// * **The PID ledger.** Every spawn writes `<ledger>/<daemon-pid>.pid` containing
///   `"<our-pid> <binary-name>"`; `Drop` removes it. [`init`] sweeps the ledger at the next
///   launch and kills any recorded daemon whose spawning Nexus is gone — covering the three
///   no-`Drop` deaths above at the exact moment the collision would otherwise happen.
/// * **The in-process registry.** [`kill_leftovers`] (the quit path, after the radio loop
///   has been told to stop) TERMs anything not yet dropped — the wedged quit, handled
///   before the process exits rather than left for the next launch.
///
/// PID reuse is the hazard of any kill-by-recorded-pid, and both directions are covered:
/// * the registry holds only OUR direct children, none of them reaped when we signal
///   (`Drop` deregisters before it reaps), so those PIDs cannot have been recycled;
/// * the sweep kills a recorded PID only when `ps` says the process behind it is still the
///   recorded *binary*; a recycled PID reads as something else and the record is dropped
///   without a kill. A recycled PARENT pid makes the parent look alive, which merely keeps
///   the record for a later launch — the conservative failure, never a kill on a guess.
///
/// When [`init`] was never called (unit tests, headless tools) nothing is written and the
/// sweep never runs — behaviour is exactly pre-ledger.
