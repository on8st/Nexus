//! A rigctld-compatible TCP **server** — the "broker, not port hog" half of CAT.
//!
//! Nexus owns one connection to the radio; this server lets WSJT-X / N1MM / Log4OM
//! (any Hamlib NET rigctl client) **share that radio through Nexus** by speaking the
//! same text protocol Hamlib's `rigctld` does, on :4532. Every command is relayed to
//! a [`RigBackend`] (Nexus's live rig state), so a logger setting the dial retunes
//! Nexus too.
//!
//! Pure protocol handling ([`handle_command`]) is unit-tested; the std-only TCP loop
//! ([`serve`]) is covered by a localhost integration test. The one piece that needs a
//! real WSJT-X to validate is the exact `\dump_state` byte layout — emitted here in
//! the classic **protocol-0** form (so the client skips the protocol-1 key=value
//! block), grounded in Hamlib's `netrigctl` parser.
