//! FT-710 waterfall over the radio's internal FT4222 USB→SPI bridge.
//!
//! WHAT THIS IS. The FT-710 contains an FT4222 USB→SPI bridge. With *SCU-LAN10* enabled in the
//! radio's menu it appears as a THIRD USB function beside the CAT bridge and the codec, on the
//! same internal hub:
//!
//! ```text
//! IOUSBHostDevice@02400000                 ← the FT-710's internal hub
//!   ├─ CP2105 Dual USB to UART @02410000   ← CAT
//!   ├─ USB Audio Device        @02420000   ← the codec
//!   └─ FT4222                  @02430000   ← this  (FTDI, VID 0x0403, PID 0x601C)
//! ```
//!
//! It is neither a serial port nor a CAT command, and both of those were ruled out by measurement
//! before this module existed: `SS` (SPECTRUM SCOPE) reads and writes scope SETTINGS only — the
//! official FT-710 CAT manual has no waveform command at all — and nothing arrives unsolicited on
//! either virtual COM port. Measured on ON8ST's station 2026-08-17: 40 frames of 4096 B in 0.48 s
//! (84/s), 850 live bins. Polarity, width, bin-to-frequency alignment and orientation are all
//! verified against a known broadcast carrier — the row runs LOW to HIGH left to right (checked by
//! moving the dial 15 kHz and confirming the signal stayed put). See FORK.md for the measurements
//! and for the one residual: about 1.1 kHz of error at 15 kHz off centre, which is quantified but
//! not yet explained.
//!
//! WHY THE SPLIT IN THIS FILE. Everything that decides what the bins MEAN is pure and tested here
//! ([`parse_wf1`], [`span_hz`], [`sweep_edges`]). The only part that needs FTDI's closed-source
//! library sits behind the off-by-default `yaesu-wf` feature and behind [`WaterfallSource`], so
//! the parsing is exercised by the suite on every platform and the FFI is the one thing a
//! licensing decision gates. **No FTDI binary is vendored into this repo** — see FORK.md: D2XX /
//! LibFT4222 is closed source and Nexus is GPL-3.0-only, which is an open question, not a settled
//! one. Fork-local until it is answered.
//!
//! HOW IT MEETS THE REST OF THE APP. The output shape is deliberately the same as the CI-V
//! scope's [`crate::civ::scope::ScopeSweep`]: bins normalised 0..1 plus the absolute RF span, so
//! the existing `rigscope` pane and `SpectrumFeed` take it with no new UI or DSP. Which RADIO a
//! bridge belongs to is answered by [`crate::usbtopo`] — the FT4222 shares its parent hub with
//! that rig's CAT port and codec, the same evidence that already labels the codec.
