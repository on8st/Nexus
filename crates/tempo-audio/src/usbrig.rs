//! Zero-config station setup: identify a connected radio from its USB descriptor.
//!
//! Two pure, testable pieces (the actual USB enumeration lives in [`crate::ports`]
//! behind the `serial` feature, and the command layer joins them):
//!
//! 1. **Driver resolver** — most ham rigs talk over a generic USB-serial bridge
//!    chip (Silicon Labs CP210x, FTDI, WCH CH340, Prolific). The chip is identified
//!    by USB **vendor id**; when its port won't bind, [`driver_hint`] points the
//!    operator at the correct *official* driver for their OS.
//! 2. **Rig matcher** — native-USB rigs report their model in the USB **product**
//!    string (e.g. `"IC-705"`). [`match_rig_model`] fuzzy-matches that against the
//!    curated [`crate::rigmodels::rig_models`] table to pre-select the Hamlib model.
//!    Rigs behind a generic bridge report only the chip name → no rig match (just a
//!    driver hint), which is the honest result.
