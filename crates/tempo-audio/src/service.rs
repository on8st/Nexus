///   not collapse them and the pill filled with the same sentence twice.

        //    tick, so a Stop TX pressed while idle is consumed here and can never stay
        //    armed to phantom-kill a later over.
        //
        //  • TX disabled (a plain "TX Off") — cuts every over EXCEPT the slot over in
        //    flight. This whole condition used to be just `!eng.tx_enabled()`, which made
        //    TX Off and Stop TX the same control. Operator (2026-07-31): "TX Off in FT8
        //    immediately halts TX as Stop TX is supposed to. TX Off should disable TX for
        //    the next cycle, but allow any ongoing TX to complete." So the SLOT over is
        //    now carved out — the latch being down is what refuses the next cycle
        //    (plan_tx), and this over plays to its frame end and unkeys on the
        //    `tx_until_ms` expiry above. Everything else the loop can key — the voice

        //    to end, and a plain TX Off must never reach for the flush on its own.

        //    hold, Stop TX did NOTHING in exactly the state the idle self-heal below

    ///   pointed at a Windows named pipe already held by another process, so `CreateFileA`
    ///   fails the way it fails on a COM port another program owns and Hamlib prints its
    ///   `serial port … is already open`. What differs from a rig on a busy COM port is only
    ///   the Windows error NUMBER inside `WinErrorShow` (231, not 5/32), and that number is not
    ///   in the reported line.
    /// - `never_answers_*` — the rig opens and stays mute. Produced over the NETWORK transport
    ///   (a TCP peer that accepts and never replies), because a serial rig cannot be simulated
    ///   here. The read path is shared: `read_block_generic`/`read_string_generic` are the same
    ///   functions for both transports, and it is their line that carries the diagnosis. Both
    ///   backend families are kept because they say different things — the old binary-protocol
    ///   FT-847 and the modern ASCII newcat FTDX10, whose burst is ~26 lines.
    /// - `wrong_baud` — a peer replying with mis-framed bytes that never terminate a frame,
    ///   which is what a baud mismatch delivers to an ASCII-CAT rig. THIS capture is not a
    ///   UTF-8 file, and that is the point: it is why the drain now reads bytes.
    ///
    /// **Not covered, and not claimed.** A wrong baud on a BINARY-protocol rig (FT-847 and

    /// the same garbage, rigctld printed nothing at all and handed back a nonsense frequency
