//! decimator ([`crate::capture_resample::CaptureResampler`]); TX playback keeps
//! the plain linear resample (upsampling has no aliasing hazard). The cpal
//! callbacks (which run on an audio thread)
//! exchange device-rate samples with this struct through lock-guarded rings;
//! [`AudioBackend::capture`]/[`AudioBackend::play`] do the resampling on the

//! Device/rate selection here is the conservative default; on a real station you
