//! Amplifier link — the wire formats for SPE Expert and Elecraft KPA, and nothing else.
//!
//! Pure codec: builds request bytes, parses reply bytes, and owns no port, no thread and no
//! state. The I/O half lives with the poller, exactly as the rotator splits its framing from its
//! transport, so every rule below is testable without an amplifier on the bench.
//!
//! # Provenance — the vendor's own document
//!
//! The SPE half is written from **"EXPERT 1.3K-FA / EXPERT 2K-FA Application Programmer's Guide,
//! Rev. 1.1" (S.P.E. s.r.l., 15.10.2015)** — the manufacturer's published protocol specification,
//! section references below are to it. No Hamlib code, expression or table is involved: this is
//! the "documented protocol" arm of the OSS-integration checklist in its cleanest form, a vendor
//! spec implemented from scratch.
//!
//! Reading the real document corrected two things an earlier reading of Hamlib's source had got
//! wrong here, and both would have broken the link on the amplifier's FIRST reply:
//!
//! - **Replies open with `0xAA`, not `0x55`** (§3). `0x55` is the host→amplifier sync only, and
//!   matching the request preamble against a reply rejects every frame the amplifier sends.
//!   Hamlib is where that error came from: `expert.c:159` says *"read the 4-byte header
//!   x55x55x55xXX"* and then never checks the bytes, so it mislabels rather than rejects — and
//!   a reader who takes the comment at its word inherits a bug Hamlib itself does not hit.
//! - **`CNT` counts the DATA bytes, checksum excluded** (§3) — it is not a whole-frame length.
//!   The spec's own worked ACK is `AA AA AA 01 0D 0D`: four header bytes, then `CNT` data and
//!   one checksum byte. Both prior readings break on real frames. `CNT - 4`, written here,
//!   underflows on that ACK. Hamlib's `bytes - 3` (`expert.c:174`) under-reads a status reply by
//!   seven — 67 data + 2 checksum + CRLF is 71 bytes after the header, and it takes 64 — leaving
//!   the tail to be read as the head of the next frame; on the 1-byte ACK it asks for a length
//!   of −2.
//!
//! # Serial settings — there is nothing for the operator to set
//!
//! 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity (§1). The maximum speed is 115200 and **the amplifier
//! adapts itself to lower speeds automatically**, so no baud field belongs in Settings. The USB
//! and RS-232 ports work independently but never simultaneously (RS-232 is on 2K-FA s/n > …102).
//!
//! # Hamlib's SPE backend, and why it is not going in front of a 2 kW amplifier
//!
//! Hamlib has three amplifier backends in total (`amplifiers/{elecraft,expert,gemini}`), and
//! Gemini is Ethernet-only — from a serial-port picker that is ONE usable amplifier, for the
//! price of a third daemon and a third port to manage. Its SPE backend calls itself "Initial
//! prototype" and carries this:
//!
//! ```text
//! case RIG_POWER_OFF:     cmd[0] = 0x0a;
//! case RIG_POWER_STANDBY: cmd[0] = 0x0a;   // the identical byte
//! ```
//!
//! The command set (§4) settles what that byte is: **`0x0A` is SWITCH OFF.** There is no standby
//! keycode at all — standby is reached with `0x0D`, the OPERATE key, which toggles. So Hamlib's
//! "standby" does not merely collide with off, it *is* off; and `expert_reset()` calls
//! `set_powerstat(STANDBY)`, so a Hamlib reset switches the amplifier off mid-session.
//!
//! # v1 is READ-ONLY, and that is a safety decision
//!
//! SPE's whole command set is front-panel KEYSTROKES (§4: INPUT, BAND ±, ANTENNA, L ±, C ±,
//! TUNE, SWITCH OFF, POWER, DISPLAY, OPERATE, CAT, arrows, SET) — relative steps and toggles,
//! no absolute setters. Every write's meaning depends on a state we learn a poll late, exactly
//! as the OPERATE toggle above shows. Only `STATUS` (0x90) is ever sent from here.
//!
//! And to say it once: putting an amplifier in standby is NOT a way to stop a transmission — the
//! exciter keeps keying and the drive passes straight through — so nothing here may ever appear
//! in a cockpit's stop-line census.

/// Which amplifier family a link speaks.
