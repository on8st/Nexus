//! Hamlib rig model numbers for the rig-control UI, split into two tiers.
//!
//! [`rig_models`] is the **verified** tier: `(model, name)` pairs we've
//! sanity-checked and that cover the radios most likely to be used for Field
//! Day / digital work. It's what the default Settings dropdown shows.
//!
//! [`all_rig_models`] is the **full** catalog: the verified tier plus a much
//! broader set of common amateur transceivers so an operator whose exact rig
//! isn't in the short list can still find it (surface this behind a "show all
//! models" toggle). Rigctld actually speaks 250+ models; this covers the
//! common transmitting amateur rigs across the major makers. For anything
//! still not listed, the operator can type the raw Hamlib model number — the
//! definitive list for their installed Hamlib is `rigctl -l`.
//!
//! Every number here is anchored on Hamlib's `include/hamlib/riglist.h`
//! (`model = 1000 * backend + index`, e.g. Dummy=1, NET=2, FLRig=4,
//! IC-7300=3073). Model indices are append-only and never renumbered across
//! Hamlib releases, so a number verified in one 4.x release holds in the next.

/// `(hamlib_model_number, friendly_name)` for the curated **verified** set of
/// common rigs. This is the default UI list.
///
/// Ordered roughly Dummy/NET first, then by manufacturer. Not exhaustive —
/// for the long tail use [`all_rig_models`] or type the model number directly;

/// - **Old Yaesu.** The FT-847/817/857/897/1000MP family does NOT speak this ASCII set; their
///   CAT is fixed 5-byte binary packets. Four stray bytes there do not merely fail — they
