//! FlexRadio native panadapter orchestrator (Wave 7) — behind the `device` feature (uses
//! tempo-net's SmartSDR/VITA parsers and tempo-app's `Engine`).
//!
//! Two threads make a Flex slice's real RF panadapter appear in Nexus's waterfall:
//! - a **TCP control** thread ([`FlexCat`]) registers Nexus as a SmartSDR client, creates a
//!   panadapter centered on the dial, learns the pan's VITA **stream id** from the async status
//!   stream, retunes the pan as the operator turns the dial, keeps the session alive, and
//!   removes the pan on teardown; and
//! - a **UDP FFT** thread receives VITA-49 datagrams, filters to that stream, reassembles the
//!   sweep ([`FftReassembler`]), and hands each completed row to [`Engine::set_spectrum_rf`],
//!   tagged with the absolute RF span so the UI draws a true RF scale.
//!
//! It coexists with the shipped Hamlib network-CAT path (this is a *second*, read-only TCP
//! client). Dropping the [`FlexSpectrum`] stops both threads and removes the pan.
//!
//! The pure helpers (command strings, RF span, bin normalization) are unit-tested here; the
//! thread orchestration + exact SmartSDR command syntax are verified on a Flex.
