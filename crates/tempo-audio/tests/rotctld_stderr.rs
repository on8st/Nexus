//! Does what the ROTATOR daemon says reach us — and do we notice when it has already died?
//!
//! The rig's daemon got stderr capture when the CI-V diagnostic was built. rotctld never did:
//! `spawn_rotctld` left the pipe closed and wrote "A rotator daemon's stderr is not piped, so
//! it never says anything here" on the field where the diagnosis would have gone. And rotctld
//! fails harder than rigctld does — measured against the bundled 4.7.1, `rotctld -m 901 -r
//! COM99` prints `serial_open: serial port COM99 does not exist` / `IO error` and **exits**,
//! where rigctld deliberately stays up ("the rig may be powered off"). So the two halves of the
//! commonest rotator failure were both invisible: the daemon was gone ~27 ms after launch, and
//! Nexus logged "rotctld launched".
//!
//! This runs the real `spawn_rotctld` against a stand-in that behaves the way the real one
//! does, and asks the handle both questions. Hamlib is deliberately not involved — the
//! mechanism under test is the pipe, the drain thread, the ring and `is_alive`, and a test that
//! needed Hamlib installed would self-skip on the machines where this regressed.
