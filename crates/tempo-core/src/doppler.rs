//! Satellite Doppler correction — the pure core.
//!
//! Everything here is arithmetic over caller-supplied numbers: a transponder,
//! a range-rate from [`crate::sat::range_rate`], and the operator's own tuning.
//! No radio, no clock, no I/O — so the behaviour that decides where you
//! transmit is unit-testable on the bench instead of only over a live bird.
//!
//! # The two corrections are not symmetric
//!
//! A satellite RECEDING at `ṙ` shifts what you HEAR down and what it HEARS up:
//!
//! - **Downlink** — the bird transmits `f_down`; you must listen at
//!   `f_down × (1 − ṙ/c)`.
//! - **Uplink** — the bird listens at `f_up`; you must transmit at
//!   `f_up × (1 + ṙ/c)` so the shift on the way up lands your signal on its
//!   receiver.
//!
//! Both, always. Correcting only the downlink is the classic half-Doppler
//! mistake: your audio sounds right while you drift off the far end of the
//! passband and nobody answers.
//!
//! # Inverting transponders
//!
//! A linear INVERTING transponder mirrors its passband: tuning UP the downlink
//! means your uplink must go DOWN, and the sidebands swap (LSB up / USB down).
//! Every RS-44/AO-7-class bird works this way. Getting it wrong doesn't just
//! sound wrong — it puts you on top of a different QSO entirely, which is why
//! [`Transponder::invert`] is per-transponder data (from SatNOGS) and never a
//! global setting.
//!
//! # Operator-follow — the part that makes it usable
//!
//! Nobody parks on a computed centre frequency. You tune the DOWNLINK to chase
//! a station drifting through the passband, and your uplink has to follow so
//! you both stay in the same conversation. So the engine's state is not a
//! frequency: it is the operator's OFFSET from transponder centre
//! ([`DopplerState::offset_hz`]), which survives while Doppler moves the
//! absolute frequencies underneath it.
