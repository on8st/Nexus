//! The application diagnostic log — one plain-text file an operator can find, read, and
//! attach to a bug report.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Before this module Nexus logged **nothing about itself**. No `env_logger`, no `tracing`,
//! no `simplelog`; and the desktop binary is built `windows_subsystem = "windows"`, so every
//! `eprintln!` in the tree goes to a stderr no window is attached to and nobody ever sees.
//! The only files Nexus could write about its own health were `nexus-crash.txt` (access
//! violations only, from the vectored handler in `main.rs`) and the CAT diagnostic. When the
//! Greek-Windows operator reported "it will not launch at all" in 2026-08, there was nothing
//! for them to send — not even the name of the last startup step that ran. This is the
//! missing thing: a timestamped, human-readable trail of the events that explain a failure.
//!
//! # The four rules it is built around
//!
//! 1. **Rotation is O(1) — a RENAME, never a rewrite.** When the active file passes
//!    [`SIZE_CAP`], it is renamed over the single previous generation and a fresh, empty file
//!    is opened. The old file is never read, never trimmed, never compacted — and nothing is
//!    ever compacted "at startup". That is the whole point: the operator's constraint on this
//!    work was that a big log must not make launch slow, and a log that trims itself by
//!    rewriting is exactly the big startup write that was ruled out. Two generations, each
//!    capped, so the worst case is a deterministic ~8 MB — a number, not a feeling.
//! 2. **Never block the caller.** The radio loop and the startup path hand lines to a bounded
//!    channel and return immediately. If the channel is full — a disk stall, a slow spinning
//!    drive — the line is **DROPPED and counted**, never waited on. The writer thread notes
//!    the count in the file itself, so a reader can see that the log has a hole rather than
//!    believing a quiet stretch was quiet. Losing a diagnostic line is a paper cut; stalling
//!    the audio loop behind a disk is a transmission fault.
//! 3. **Never log a secret.** This file is DESIGNED to be emailed to a stranger. Every line —
//!    without exception, because there is exactly one function that writes to the file and it
//!    applies this before anything reaches the buffer — goes through [`redact`], which masks
//!    credential-shaped text. See that function for what "structurally hard" means here and
//!    what it does not mean.
//! 4. **Log what diagnoses a failure, not what happened.** Startup milestones, CAT and audio
//!    open/failure, updater events, panics, webview failures. **No per-decode or per-tick
//!    traffic**: a log that fills with routine activity is useless *and* defeats the size
//!    bound by pushing the interesting lines out of the previous generation.
//!
//! # Shape on disk
//!
//! ```text
//! nexus-diag.log     ← active
//! nexus-diag.1.log   ← the previous generation, whole and untouched
//! ```
//!
//! Both live beside `nexus-crash.txt`, so there is ONE folder to tell an operator to look in.
//!
//! Until [`init`] is called this module is inert: every logging call is an atomic load and a
//! return, and no file is created. That keeps it out of unit tests and off any target that
//! has no business writing files.
