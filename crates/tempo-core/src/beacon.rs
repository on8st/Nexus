//! Beacon transmit scheduling for WSPR and FST4W.
//!
//! These modes are **not QSO modes**. There is no exchange to sequence and no
//! station to answer: the operator picks a fraction of intervals to transmit on,
//! and the rest are spent listening. That decision belongs here rather than in the
//! auto-sequencer, which would otherwise try to work the beacons it hears.
//!
//! # Why a percentage at all
//! A beacon that transmits every interval hears nothing, and WSPR's value is the
//! two-way picture — your reports of others matter as much as theirs of you. The
//! convention is to transmit a minority of intervals.
//!
//! Both schedulers here are ports of WSJT-X 3.0.2, cited inline. They are pure
//! functions of their own state so they can be tested without a clock or a radio.

/// The beacon message format, `"CALL GRID DBM"`.
///
/// Re-exported from the `wspr` crate so callers reach one definition: WSPR and
/// FST4W carry the SAME payload shape, differing only in the code that carries it.

///   if (carry_) { carry_ = false; }
///   else if (tx_percent_ < 40 && last_was_tx_ && tx) {
///     // if percentage is less than 40 then avoid consecutive tx but

///     tx = false;

/// ⭐ THE `carry_` RULE IS THE SUBTLE PART, and dropping it would look harmless.
/// Below 40 % it suppresses back-to-back transmissions — two in a row from a
/// low-duty beacon wastes the listening window that makes the mode useful — but it
/// sets `carry_` so the suppressed transmission is taken on the NEXT interval
/// unconditionally. Without the carry the achieved duty cycle would sag well below
/// what the operator asked for; without the suppression a 20 % beacon would
/// occasionally key twice in four minutes. It is a rate-preserving spread, not a
