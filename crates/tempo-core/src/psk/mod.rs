//! PSK31 — varicode character layer + BPSK demodulator (receive side).
//!
//! [`varicode`] is the pure character codec (the G3PLX table: self-framing
//! variable-length codes separated by `00`, idle = continuous zeros). [`demod`]
//! is the receive DSP, written from scratch for Nexus: NCO mix at the tuned
//! audio frequency → ×24 decimation to 500 Hz (16 samples/symbol at 31.25 Bd)
//! → one-symbol raised-cosine matched filter → 16-phase symbol sync →
//! differential slicer → varicode decode, with a slew-limited AFC clamped to
//! ±25 Hz and a signal-quality squelch that gates the printed output only.
//!
//! Every decoded character carries a soft confidence (0..1) from the slicer's
//! phase-error margin, and the demodulator sits behind the mode-neutral
//! [`crate::textmode::TextDemod`] seam — the same ensemble RTTY decodes into,
//! so the transcript/print stage never learns a modulation.
//!
//! [`modulator`] is the transmit half (Keyboard Modes Phase 2): cosine-shaped
//! reversals at the tuned offset, idle = continuous reversals, resumable
//! chunked rendering for continuous TX — proven against [`demod`] by the
//! TX→RX loopback tests there.
//!
//! [`qpsk`] is the QPSK31 layer (Keyboard Modes Phase 3): the K=5 rate-1/2
//! convolutional code, the four-phase differential wire mapping (an interop
//! contract — its sources are recorded in that module's header), the soft
//! Viterbi decoder the demodulator forks into at the slicer when
//! [`PskModeKind::Qpsk31`] is selected, and the QPSK transmit stream over the
//! same shaped-boundary generator.
