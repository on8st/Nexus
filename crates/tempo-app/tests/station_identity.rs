//! Golden identity harness for the STATION-WIDE half of `Engine`.
//!
//! # Why this exists — `watch_identity` is blind here
//!
//! `watch_identity` byte-compares a scripted session's snapshot and is the acceptance gate for
//! the multi-radio work. But every station-wide field in its fixture sits at its DEFAULT:
//! `highlights: []`, `hunt: null`, `pendingLog: null`, `uploadNote: null`, `radios: []`, and
//! every roster station `worked:false country:null gridRarity:null lotwUser:false`. It proves
//! the per-chain half survived and that the station half kept its SHAPE — it cannot detect a
//! semantic change in any station-wide behaviour.
//!
//! That was fine for Phase 1a, which moved per-chain decoder state (richly covered). It is
//! exactly the wrong gate for the StationCore extraction, which moves the logbook, the
//! worked-before indices, the connectors, the activation and the hunt target — i.e. precisely
//! the fields the other fixture leaves empty.
//!
//! So this harness drives station state to NON-DEFAULT values and pins the result:
//!   * a logbook with real QSOs, so worked-before stamping has something to say
//!   * DXCC / grid-rarity / LoTW resolvers installed, so country, gridRarity and lotwUser
//!     stamp onto the roster instead of staying null
//!   * an active POTA activation, which log_qso stamps onto every contact
//!   * a pending hunt target, which the snapshot surfaces
//!
//! Same rules as its sibling: byte-compare against a checked-in fixture, blank ONLY genuinely
//! time-derived fields, and treat any other difference as a finding rather than a rebaseline.
