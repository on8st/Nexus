//! US (FCC Part 97, ITU Region 2 / contiguous US) amateur transmit privileges by license
//! class — the data + logic behind the transmit lockout and the "jump to the start of my
//! licensed segment" band dropdown. Pure (no IO); heavily tested because it's a legal guard.
//!
//! Verified 2026-06-09 against the ARRL frequency-allocations table + 47 CFR §97.301/§97.305
//! (incl. the 60 m subband effective 2026-02-13). Conventions:
//! - CW (A1A) is allowed across the class's whole authorized span on a band.
//! - DATA/RTTY (FT8/FT4 etc.) is allowed only in the no-phone lower segments on HF, but
//!   band-wide above 50 MHz (and on 30 m, all-data).
//! - PHONE/image is allowed only in the phone segments.
//!
//! `Open` = no restrictions (non-US operators); `tx_allowed` short-circuits to true. Its rows
//! are therefore a PARKING table, not a privilege one — which is why `Open` alone also carries
//! [`REGION1`], the 4 m band the US table has no way to describe.
