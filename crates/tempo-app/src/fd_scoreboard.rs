//! Field Day spectator scoreboard — a read-only LAN HTTP server for the club TV.
//!
//! Host Nexus serves one self-contained dark big-screen page (embedded at build
//! time, nothing on disk) plus two JSON routes the page polls every 3 s. The
//! server is hand-rolled over `std::net::TcpListener` in the mold of
//! `tempo_audio::rigctld_server` — GET/HEAD only, no bodies read, no keep-alive,
//! `Connection: close` on every reply — so there is no HTTP dependency to
//! license-review and nothing here a request can mutate.
//!
//! **Read-only by construction**: the serve loop takes a [`BoardSource`] — a
//! snapshot-JSON provider — never an engine or app-state handle. There is no
//! code path from a socket to a setter; "never expose rig control" is
//! structural, not filtered. A colocated test pins that this file names no
//! app-state type at all.
//!
//! **Threat model** (stated, not hidden): anyone on the LAN can read the board —
//! the contest log (calls/sections/bands), operator callsigns per position,
//! claimed bonuses. All of it is information already broadcast on the air in
//! cleartext by the very nature of the event; that is why no-auth plain HTTP is
//! acceptable *for this data* and would not be for anything else. A hostile LAN
//! peer can hammer the port: the request-line/header caps, the 5 s read
//! timeout and the ≤ 32-connection ceiling bound the cost — worst case the
//! board goes stale, the radio side is untouched. The feature is default-off;
//! enabling it is the deliberate LAN opt-in.
//!
//! **Scoring honesty**: the score block is computed by replaying the merged
//! rows through [`tempo_core::fieldday::FieldDayLog`] and asking the active
//! [`tempo_core::fd_rules`] ruleset — the same dedupe and the same math every
//! other surface uses, never re-derived. For WFD (`ScoringModel::Objectives`)
//! the payload carries **no power fields at all**, so the page *cannot* render
//! ARRL power math for an event that has none: the headline is raw QSO points
//! and the ×(n+1) projection is a labelled secondary (multipliers apply at
//! submission). WFD bonus points ride along informationally but are not folded
//! into the provisional headline. Golden-payload tests pin both shapes.
