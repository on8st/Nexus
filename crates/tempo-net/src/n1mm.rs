//! N1MM+ native contact broadcast — the `<contactinfo>` UDP XML datagram
//! (official: n1mmwp.hamdocs.com/appendices/external-udp-broadcasts/).
//!
//! N1MM-networked clubs run aggregation dashboards (n1mm_view-style) that
//! consume these datagrams; emitting them per Field Day QSO makes Nexus a
//! first-class station on that network. Emit-only: N1MM itself never accepts
//! inbound contactinfo (its UDP intake is spectrum/freq data only).
//!
//! The same datagram serves a SECOND audience, which is why the fields here are
//! not all contest fields: live map/dashboard consumers (OpenHamClock,
//! GridTracker) plot each broadcast contact as it is logged, contest or not. So
//! Nexus emits contactinfo on two paths — per Field Day contact from the radio
//! loop, and (when the operator enables it) per ORDINARY logged QSO from the
//! shell's log forwarder. Those two read disjoint logs, so a contact is never
//! broadcast twice; the invariant is pinned by
//! `a_field_day_contact_never_enters_the_general_upload_queue` in tempo-app.
