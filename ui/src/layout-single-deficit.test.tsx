// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// `.layout.single`: VERTICAL DEFICIT MUST HAVE A LEGAL FATE IN EVERY .panel-ROOTED VIEW.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR (2026-08-04). Three rules in styles.css combined into a
// dead scrollbar by CONSTRUCTION, not by content:
//
//   .layout.single          { display: block; overflow-y: auto }   ← the valve
//   .layout.single > .panel { height: 100% }                       ← what welded it shut
//   .panel                  { overflow: hidden }                   ← what ate the deficit
//
// `height: 100%` resolves against the layout's CONTENT box, so the layout's scrollHeight can
// never exceed its clientHeight and its `overflow-y: auto` can never paint a thumb. The panel
// is then a hard clip with nothing between it and the content, so whatever the flex column
// could not shrink went off the bottom and stayed there: Logbook's "Log" submit at 1024×768
// with the manual form open, Program's whole delivery row (Export for CHIRP…/Export CSV/Save
// to Memory Bank/Clear). Five views had already escaped that rule one at a time — the two
// `:has()` rules, `.aprs-cockpit`, the triple-class cockpit shells, and POTA's own
// `overflow-y: auto` — which is the tell that the base rule, not the views, was wrong.
//
// WHY THE VALVE IS ON THE PANEL AND NOT ON THE LAYOUT. Letting the panel grow past 100%
// (`min-height: 100%`) would make the LAYOUT scroll — and would destroy every view that
// works today, because the panel's DEFINITE height is exactly what bounds the inner
// scrollers. With an auto-height panel a `flex: 1; min-height: 0` child contributes its
// max-content height to the container's intrinsic main size (CSS Flexbox §9.9.1), so
// `.settings-scroll`, `.log-scroll` (the virtualizer's scroll element) and `.rp-results`
// would each inflate to their full content and stop scrolling. The panel keeps its definite
// height and owns its own deficit instead — fate #1 in the cockpit-panes model, "a scrollbar
// inside the pane that overflowed". Both halves are pinned below.
//
// HOW THIS GUARD COMPUTES. jsdom parses the REAL styles.css; matching is done by the REAL
// selector engine (so `:has()`, `>` and `[data-viewport]` behave), and this file resolves the
// cascade itself — importance, then specificity, then source order — because jsdom's
// getComputedStyle does NOT expand the `overflow` shorthand into `overflow-y`. A rule that
// exists and LOSES therefore fails here, which is the failure mode that shipped two dead
// fixes. The two named traps are RENDERED (real components, real markup) and the guard walks
// from the trapped control outward to `.layout.single`, asking the only question that
// matters: going out, is the first box that does not let overflow escape a SCROLLER or a CLIP?
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. jsdom does not lay out, so no pixel claim here is verified. The
// 1024×768 @115%/@120% cases are pinned as the RESPONSIVE STATE they produce
// (data-viewport='sm' plus --vh-eff 667.8px / 640px), which is what a `[data-viewport]` rule
// could re-clip under. THAT the deficit exists at those sizes is an operator observation;
// that it has somewhere to go is what this file computes.

//
// The Field Day view is a plain `.layout.single > .panel` view — `<main class="layout single">`
// → `<section class="conversation panel fieldday">` — and is in the PANEL_VIEWS census above
// accordingly. (It used to mount in the three-pane operating workspace,
// `.layout[data-three-pane]` → `.grid-center`; the operator asked on 2026-08-30 why a
// scoreboard was wearing a waterfall, and App.tsx moved it. The shell swap is guarded in
// fdDashboardShell.test.tsx; what is guarded HERE is that the column's own deficit story
// survived it, which is why this block re-mounts the view in the new chain rather than
// trusting that it did.)
//
// THE DEFECT (2026-08-04). The Field Day column is: banner, header, operator row, score
// tiles, sections board, the Bonuses disclosure, the log. Every one of them is
// `flex: 0 0 auto` EXCEPT the sections board (`SECTIONS_BOARD_WRAP { flex: 1 1 auto;
// minHeight: 0 }`), which made the board the column's single unfloored absorber: it paid
// for every sibling's growth all the way down to zero, and past zero `.panel`'s clip ate
// the rest. `.fd-bonuses-list`'s `max-height: calc(0.3 * var(--vh-eff))` was written as the
// fix and carried a comment claiming "the growth now stops here instead of travelling to
// the siblings" — but a cap is a fraction of the SAME viewport the slack comes from, so it
// bounds the list's own height and does nothing about that height displacing anyone. Open
// Bonuses at 1200×750 and the club-loved sections board still went to a blank strip, with
// the residual off the bottom of the log and no scrollbar anywhere in the chain.
//
// THE TWO HALVES, and neither works alone. A floor on the board with no valve above it
// converts the crush into a CLIP (strictly worse); a valve with no floor never fires,
// because an unfloored `flex: 1 1 auto` child shrinks to zero before the column can
// overflow. So: the board carries the floor, and `.fieldday` owns the deficit past it.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE: jsdom does not lay out, so "the board keeps 180px" is not
// verified here — what is verified is that the floor exists on the box the outer flex
// actually sizes, that nothing inside it competes for that floor, and that the deficit the
