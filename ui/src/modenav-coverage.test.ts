// Regression guard for the "orphaned view" bug: a section can be declared in the
// feature registry (non-core, with a `view`) and enabled in Settings, yet have NO
// button in the ModeNav rail — leaving the view unreachable. `spots` hit exactly
// this. This test asserts every enable-able (non-core) section view is reachable
// from the rail, so the whole class of bug can't recur.
//
// Some non-core section views are rendered by DEDICATED buttons rather than the
// generic ITEMS array (Phone + CW get their own operating-group buttons; RTTY +
// SSTV are Digital-group sub-buttons), so they are reachable without an ITEMS
// entry. Core sections (operate/chat/connect/needed/logbook/settings) are
// excluded by the non-core filter below.
