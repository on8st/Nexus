// Platform detection for operator-facing text and modifier chords.

// The gesture/chord POLICY is platform-independent on purpose — Ctrl and Cmd are both
// accepted everywhere they gate an action (cheap, harmless, and it means a mac operator's
// ⌘ muscle memory and a Windows habit both work on either box). Only the LABELS branch:
// advertising "Ctrl" to a mac operator points them at the OS right-click gesture
// (Ctrl+click) or Mission Control's Spaces chords (Ctrl+digit). Module-level so every
// label site agrees; the same check SettingsPanel has used since the serial-hint work.
