 * bump instead, so they weigh 0 here exactly as they do there.
 *
 * NOTE there is no "new band-mode" rank, here or in the backend: `LogNeeds::need` decides
 * the DXCC axis with a short-circuit that never consults mode once the band is missing, so
 * a slot needed on band AND mode reports NewBand alone (dxped.rs). Band and mode needs are
