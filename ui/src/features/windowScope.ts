// Window/surface identity — the one place that decides which storage keys are shared
// between windows and which are private to this one.
//
// A SURFACE is (view, instance) — see `surfaceId`, which is what per-surface storage keys
// off; a WINDOW hosts exactly one surface. `instance` is an
// opaque VALIDATED TOKEN: `main` (the docked surface in the main window), `w<n>` (an
// extra unbound surface — a torn-off panel or a second-monitor board) or `r<id>` (bound
// to a RadioProfile.id; multi-radio, not reachable yet). Nothing outside this file ever
// interprets it — it is a key component only.
//
// Panel VISIBILITY is SURFACE-scoped, deliberately. An app-global flag is exactly what
// makes a docked and a popped-out copy of the same view fight over one value — the
// `nexus.waterfall.detached` defect this replaces.
//
// ## `main` writes the BARE key. This is the whole zero-migration property.
//
// Every key routed through here except `nexus.panels.*` already exists on operators'
// disks, unsuffixed, written by builds that had never heard of an instance. So the
// primary surface must keep producing the byte-identical string — `tempo-right-rail-w`,
// not `tempo-right-rail-w.main` — or an upgrade silently orphans every saved rail width,
// zoom pin, map projection and board filter. That mirrors `chains.rs::panel_label`, which
// makes the same promise for window LABELS (`panel-{slug}` for Main, suffixed above it),
// and `windowScope.test.ts` pins it as literal strings rather than as a property.
//
// `nexus.panels.*` is the one exception and it goes the other way: it shipped in 0.15.0
// ALREADY suffixed (`nexus.panels.operate.main`), so for that key the byte-identical
// string is the suffixed one. It therefore builds its key itself — see panelState.ts.
//
// ## A new surface INHERITS, then diverges
//
// `surfaceGet` falls back to the bare (primary) key when this surface has never written
// one. Without that, popping a panel out would reset it to first-run defaults — which is
// a regression, not a feature: `nexus.connect.projection` exists PRECISELY so a torn-off
// map opens on the globe the operator was already using (see MapView.tsx). Inheriting
// costs nothing in the other direction, because the first write makes the surface its own.

 * a torn-off `waterfall` and a torn-off `operate` (which embeds a waterfall) both wrote the
 * same zoom key, and `bandmapCw` + `bandmapPhone` both wrote the same spot-legend key. Two
