// Decode alerts: a WebAudio beep + a visual toast, fired from the live decode
// feed and gated by user settings.
//
// We do NOT alert on every decode — that's noise. Experienced operators want
// loud, aggressive alerts ONLY for the things worth chasing:
// - alertMyCall → a decode directed at my callsign (someone calling me)
// - alertNew    → a NEW DXCC entity (a "new one" — aggressive) or a new grid
// - alertCq     → a plain CQ (off by default; opt-in, since CQs are constant)
//
// Each unique decode (from + message + freq) alerts at most once.

//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). Every word an alert
// says comes from the catalog. What does NOT: the callsign, the DXCC entity name, the grid
// square and the watch filter's own label — they are interpolated as they arrive. The two
// optional clauses (` — <entity>` and the grid after "grid") are assembled here as WHOLE
// clauses and handed in, so a toast with neither never carries a dangling separator.
