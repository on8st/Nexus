// DOES THE MANUAL COVER WHAT WE SHIPPED?
//
// Every other doc guard in this tree checks that documentation which EXISTS is correct:
// `docs-match-code` checks quoted values, `docs-settings-pointers` checks routes,
// `gen-settings-reference --check` and `gen-wiki --check` check generated pages are current.
// All of them are green when a capability has NO documentation at all, because there is no
// page for them to be wrong about. That is the hole this file closes.
//
// It is not hypothetical. PSK31 and QPSK31 shipped as the headline of 1.7.0 — a whole
// operating section with two sub-modes, a cockpit, transmit and receive — and the manual
// never gained a chapter. Nothing went red: not CI, not the release-docs pass, not the site
// build. It was found by an operator reading the website and asking where PSK was, four
// releases later. macOS went the same way on the site side: a shipped platform that four
// separate platform lists said nothing about.
//
// THE RULE: a shipped section is a promise to explain it. If `features/registry.ts` — the
// single source of truth for what Nexus offers — lists a section, the manual owes it a
// chapter, and the guide index owes that chapter a link. A capability nobody can read about
// is, from the operator's chair, a capability that does not exist, which is the same
// reasoning the settings registry and its 228 deep links were built on.
//
// WHY THIS IMPORTS THE REGISTRY INSTEAD OF PARSING IT. The first version of this check
// regex-scanned registry.ts and found FIVE sections; there are twenty-two. A parser that silently
// under-reports turns this guard into a green light for the exact gap it exists to catch, so
// the list comes from the module itself and cannot drift from what the app ships.
