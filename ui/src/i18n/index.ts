// THE i18n RUNTIME — string lookup, interpolation, plurals, and the invariant-token rule.
//
// Zero dependencies, on purpose. The alternatives (react-i18next, LinguiJS, react-intl) all
// carry a plugin/backend architecture — loaders that fetch catalogs, language detectors, ICU
// message compilers — that this application must not have: Nexus runs in a field-day tent with
// no network, so every catalog is a static import, and the plural data every one of those
// libraries ships is already in the webview as `Intl.PluralRules`. What is left after removing
// what we must not use is this file. See `docs/guide/i18n.md` for the full comparison.
//
// SHAPE: this is the `units.ts` pattern one level up — pure formatting at the DISPLAY EDGE,
// nothing here ever touches a wire value, a persisted value, or a value on its way to the
// radio. Read that sentence again before adding anything to this module.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⚠️ THE INVARIANT-TOKEN RULE — the part of i18n that can put a station off frequency.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Localisation applies to PROSE. It does not apply to the technical vocabulary of amateur
// radio, and the difference is not stylistic: `14,074` is not `14.074`, and a decimal comma
// that reaches a dial, a log, a settings file or a CAT command is an operating fault, not a
// cosmetic one. A German or Greek Windows install is one `toLocaleString()` away from it.
//
// TWO CATEGORIES, and every string in the app is in exactly one:
//
//   TRANSLATABLE PROSE — labels, hints, tooltips, button text, error sentences, empty states,
//   accessible names, and human example values (a first name, "leave blank if that is you").
//   These become catalog entries.
//
//   INVARIANT TECHNICAL TOKENS — never translated, never locale-formatted, never in a catalog:
//     • frequencies and any number that is one (dial MHz, offsets, shifts, tone Hz, baud)
//     • signal reports (599, -14 dB, S9+20), power in watts, WPM, percentages of a technical
//       quantity
//     • callsigns, grid squares, DXCC prefixes, ITU/CQ zones, ARRL/RAC section codes
//     • band names (20m), mode names (FT8, USB, PSK31), Q-codes (QSY, QRZ), RST, SOTA/POTA refs
//     • ADIF field names (OPERATOR, STATION_CALLSIGN) and macro tokens ({NAME}, {MYSTATE})
//     • every `value` of a <select>, every persisted key, every id — the LABEL is prose, the
//       VALUE is a token, and they are not the same string
//     • example values that are drawn from a technical namespace (`KD9TAW`, `EN52xa`, `WI`)
//
// MECHANICALLY, that means:
//   1. Interpolated numbers are stringified by `invariantNumber` (below) — `String(n)`, which
//      is always `.`-decimal and never grouped. `t()` CANNOT emit a localised number.
//   2. Nothing in this module, or in any module it calls, uses `toLocaleString`,
//      `toLocaleDateString`, `Intl.NumberFormat` or `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. The one `Intl` API
//      used is `PluralRules`, which returns a category name, not a formatted number.
//   3. A component that needs a number in prose formats it itself, invariantly, and passes the
//      finished string. If a future surface genuinely wants a grouped count ("1,234 QSOs"),
//      that formatter goes at that call site with the category rule quoted, never in `t()`.
//   4. The active locale is a PROSE setting. It must never be read by, derived from, or
//      written to anything that formats, parses, persists or transmits a number. `units.ts`
//      already sniffs the OS locale for metric/imperial DISPLAY — that is the boundary, and it
//      converts at the display edge for the same reason.
//
// `i18n.invariant.test.ts` holds this to a positive control: it proves a de-DE formatter
// really does produce a comma (so the check can fail) and then proves our path does not.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MISSING TRANSLATIONS FALL BACK TO ENGLISH — always, structurally.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `rawMessage` reads the active catalog, then the English one. A key the active locale lacks —
// or has as an empty string, which is what a half-finished machine translation looks like —
// resolves to the English source string. The operator sees English, never a key and never a
// blank. The English catalog cannot itself have a hole: `MessageKey` is `keyof typeof EN`.
