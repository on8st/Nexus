 * NOT subscribe keeps the old language until something unrelated re-renders it — which is worse
 * than not switching at all, because half the screen changes and half does not.
 *
 * Both events: `storage` reaches Nexus's POP-OUT windows (a band map, a detached panel), and the
 * same-window event reaches the window that made the change, which `storage` never does.

 * before main.tsx's callback installs the German catalog. The array froze at ['en'], the
 * picker's `length > 1` never became true, and a finished and shipped translation could not be
 * selected at all. A snapshot of a registry that is filled in later is always a bug; read it
 * when the question is asked.

 * worth copying — Windows', Firefox's, WSJT-X's — lists the native name.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY LOCALE main.tsx INSTALLS NEEDS A ROW HERE. The picker falls back to the raw tag,
 * which is right — a missing name must not blank the option — but it is also silent, so
 * Spanish and French shipped in 1.8.2-test2 offering an operator "es" and "fr" to choose
 * between. Complete catalogs, and a menu that read like a config file. locale-switch.test.ts
 * now fails when a shipped language has no row, so the omission cannot be quiet again.
