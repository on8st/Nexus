// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// SETTINGS USES THE WINDOW IT HAS — and nothing inside it stretches to fill one.
//
// THE REPORT (operator, 2026-08-12): "make the settings full screen. It's small and in the
// middle. You have the opportunity to put far more on the page vs scrolling."
//
// THE CAUSE. `.layout.single > .panel { max-width: 1100px; margin: 0 auto }` capped every
// single-panel view, and the only override widened Logbook and Program at xl. Settings was
// classed as "prose-shaped" and kept the 1100px measure — but Settings is 40 `.settings-grid`s
// of labelled controls, where width buys COLUMNS, not longer lines. A 1920 window classifies
// as **lg**, so it was rendering a 1100px panel in a 1900px space: 820px of gutter, paid for
// in scrolling. (An xl-only override would not have touched the reported window at all.)
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A GREP. Widening a container is the easy half; the half
// that breaks things is everything inside it that had been bounded only by accident. Four
// shapes needed their own measure and one grid needed a different auto-placement mode, and
// every one of those is a rule that has to WIN a cascade against the base rule it overrides.
// A presence check ("the file contains max-width: 72ch") passes just as happily when the rule
// loses — which is how dead fixes shipped twice in this sheet. So this guard resolves the
// cascade itself and asks what value actually applies, per viewport tier.
//
// HOW IT COMPUTES. Declarations are parsed from the RAW sheet text (brace- and comment-aware)
// rather than read back through jsdom's CSSOM, because jsdom's CSSStyleDeclaration silently
// drops properties it does not implement — `grid-template-columns` among them, which is half
// the fix. Matching is still done by jsdom's REAL selector engine on REAL markup shapes, so
// `>`, attribute selectors and specificity behave as the browser would. Winner = importance,
// then specificity, then source order.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. jsdom does not lay out. No pixel here is measured: "the panel fills
// a 1920 window" is not verified, only that nothing caps it at that tier, and "the grid gains
// three columns" is not verified, only that the track-sizing function that produces columns
// rather than stretch is the one that applies. Those need eyes on a real window.
