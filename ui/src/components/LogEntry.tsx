            AIR could not be entered at all.

            fits in the slack a wrapped line leaves. In the QTH row it did not —
            that row is a single full line at a 611 px column, so Grid pushed it to two and
            made the satellite strip TALLER than the park row it replaced (+52 vs
            −48). Measured in a real layout engine, and its two halves are pinned:
            LogEntry.test.tsx › 'sits in the EXCHANGE row' and 'the QTH row is
            BYTE-FOR-BYTE the same four fields' hold the placement, and
            panel-overflow.test.ts › '.le-grid fits the LINE BUDGET' computes the

          instead (operator: several logged by accident, 2026-08-02). Here it is a deliberate
          reach, directly under the line that states what will be written, and Spot stays beside
          it — that adjacency is why spotting happens at all. Plain in-flow row: the pane body is
          the scroller, this adds no sticky/fixed positioning and no second scroll owner.

          `position: sticky; bottom: 0` WAS PROPOSED FOR THIS ROW (2026-08-04 density review) and

          an existing `overflow: auto` box adds no second scroller. It is refused because this row
          is not the last block in the strip. RecallPanel follows it, so an opaque sticky commit
          row parks Log over the recall card — its QRZ link included — for the whole scroll, and a
          reach for something underneath commits a contact instead. That is the 2026-08-02 accident
          again, from a fixed screen band rather than a wrapping row. It would also cut Log loose
          from the "logs to the shared logbook as …" line above it, which is the placement's whole
          point. The fold problem it was aimed at was answered by deleting chrome instead: the
          heading and the card-in-card padding, 43px of it above this row (LogEntry.density.test). */}
