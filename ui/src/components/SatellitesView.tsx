// Satellites — the top-level section: WHEN to try WHICH bird, favorites first.
// Modeled on the workflow of the field's standard tools (CSN S.A.T., SatPC32,
// Look4Sat): a favorites set drives everything (declutter + prediction focus),
// a ranked "your best passes" strip answers the when/which question in one
// line, the 48 h schedule carries countdowns + ⏰ pass alarms, and the detail
// zone shows the pass on the SKY DOME (hero when a pass is live) with SatNOGS
// frequencies/status (community-measured truth — absent when offline, never
// guessed). The Connect "Satellite Passes" pane stays as the compact glance
// view; this is the planning surface.
//
// 2026-07-31 (UX litigation): "Work this pass" is ONE control that runs the
// whole chain (select → auto-pick a workable transponder → arm), the readiness
// rail renders the chain AS a chain (four gates, each fixable in place), and
// tracking is rotor-LESS capable — the backend runs the pass clock + Doppler
// without a rotator, and the arm affordance renders for everyone. Schedule
// rows carry Phase 2 `earn` (needed grids/entities) in the app's one need-chip
// vocabulary. Arming stays the operator's click, every time: nothing here
// moves a rotor or takes a dial on its own.

 * FT4, Q65 without the display submode, FST4W as itself, TempoFast/TempoDeep)
 * — so the tier string is used verbatim rather than re-mapped here where the
 * two tables could drift.
 *
 * The SECTION gate matters: `link.tier` always names a tier (the decoder is

 * voice pass worked from the Phone cockpit as FT8. Only the digital section
 * says the operator is actually working the tier.

 * A MANUAL az/el rotator is turned by hand off these two numbers. Hover-only

 * there for the whole pass. (The <title> stays for assistive tech, and the
 * readout list below the dome stays as the DOM text equivalent.)
 *
 * Geometry lives here rather than in CSS because the plate is sized to the text
 * it holds: the mono glyph box is 0.6 em, and the font size is emitted as an
 * attribute right beside this arithmetic so the two cannot drift apart. Ink —
 * fill, family, weight — stays in styles.css.
 *
 * ⚠️ THESE NUMBERS WENT UP SO THE TEXT GOT SMALLER. Read the arithmetic before
 * "correcting" one of them back. They are viewBox units, so what an operator
 * actually sees is
 *
 *     rendered px = unit × (rendered dome px ÷ 248)
 *
 * and the dome's rendered size is set in CSS (`.sat-dome`). Operator,
 * 2026-08-03: "the actual aos, los and az, el text could be made smaller by
 * 25%". At the supported 1024×768 floor the dome used to render 458 px wide, so
 * TAG_FS 10 drew these at 18.5 effective px — the LARGEST type in the section,
 * bigger than the <h1>. That is what he was looking at.
 *
 * The same pass rebuild caps the dome at 0.31·--vh-eff = 280 px there (he asked
 * for the dome to come down in the same breath), and 10 × 280/248 = 11.3 px
 * would be a 39% cut — more than he asked for, and heading toward the app's
 * 11 px size floor on the number a manual-rotor operator reads mid-turn. So the
 * constants are RAISED, and the pair lands on the quarter he asked for:
 *
 *     12.3 × 280/248 = 13.9 px   against today's 18.5 px   → −24.8%
 *
 * ⚠️ 12.3 IS A GEOMETRIC CEILING, not a taste. tagSize() makes the plate
 * 7 × TAG_FS × 0.6 + 2·TAG_PAD wide for "az 143°", and `tagPlace` flips it to
 * the bird's LEFT the moment its right edge would pass the horizon box
 * (x = 224). At the mid-pass fixture az 143 / el 47 the bird sits at x = 152.8,
 * so the plate has 62.2 u to work in; 12.3 spends 60.3 of them. TAG_FS 14.5 was
 * tried first and flipped that plate to the wrong side —
 * SatellitesView.skydome.test.tsx's "rides on the bird's right when that side
 * is free" caught it, and the constant was wrong, not the test. TAG_LINE and
 * TAG_PAD scale with TAG_FS (×1.15 and ×0.35) so the plate stays proportioned
 * to the text it holds.
 *
 * Stated honestly, because it is not −25% everywhere: above the floor today's
 * dome grew with the column (25.5 px at 1366×768, 40.6 px at 3440×1440) while

 * exactly the pass where the operator most needs to tell the rise bearing from

/* ==================== the transponder passband strip ========================
 * ONE axis, shared by both legs: offset from the passband CENTRE, in kHz.
 * The legs sit on different bands (145 MHz up, 435 MHz down), so plotting them
 * against absolute frequency would be a two-scale chart whose alignment is
 * arbitrary — it would invent a relationship. The offset is the coordinate
 * they genuinely share, and the one an inverting transponder mirrors.
 *
 * The lesson IS the geometry: the downlink sits at +offset and the uplink at
 * −offset while the transponder inverts, so tuning up the band walks the two
 * marks apart in opposite directions. Nothing animates to explain that.
 *
 * Doppler lives in the NUMBERS, never in the marks. Correction moves the DIAL
 * so the operator's place inside the passband stays where they put it —
 * sliding the band would animate a thing that is not moving.
 *
 * Colour: --rx on the downlink mark, --tx on the uplink, the transmit/receive
 * tokens every operator already reads. In the LIGHT theme that pair separates
 * by only ΔE 6.1 under deuteranopia, which is good enough ONLY because three
 * secondary encodings carry the same distinction: the legs are on separate
 * rows, each row carries a text label, and each carries a direction glyph
 * (↓ downlink / ↑ uplink) in both the label text and the SHAPE of its mark.
 * Drop any one of the three and this instrument stops working for a red-green
 * colourblind operator — SatellitesView.passband.test.tsx pins all three.

            still send its map: that mapping is NOT in force yet — and neither
            is the correction ('switch-mapping'), which sends its map for the
            same reason.

            'switch-mapping' is also the one offer rendered while the uplink IS
            ours: the operator consented to a mapping whose split the engine

            is exactly the wrong question there. It is the only exception, and

 * and mirrors the uplink to it. What had no way back was leaving the passband
 * — by hand, or because the rig came back on a different frequency — after
 * which the dial is somewhere the pass does not describe. The transponder
 * cards cannot fix that either: they are radio inputs, and clicking the one
 * already selected fires no change event, so the pick that would re-assert
 * everything was literally unreachable while it was the pick in force.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: re-runs that pick — `setSatTransponder(name, index)`, the same
 * command the card runs — so routing, the band, the commanded mode and both
 * legs all come with it, rather than shoving a frequency at the rig behind the
 * bookkeeping's back. It re-centres in the passband, which is what "the implied
 * frequency" means; a position you tuned to by hand is not something to
 * preserve while asking to be put back on the bird.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT IN THE DOPPLER READOUT (where it shipped first, and where it
 * was unreachable — operator report twice). The readout is where the
 * frequencies are, so it looked like the obvious home. But that block renders
 * only once a pass is ARMED, and its head — the half holding the button — only
 * once Doppler has REPORTED a tuning, which it does not do until AOS. So the
 * recovery control did not exist in either state where the dial most often
 * gets away from you: a transponder picked with no pass armed (the pick tunes
 * the radio immediately — that dial is live), and an armed pass waiting for
 * AOS. A control whose whole job is "put me back" cannot be gated on the
 * numbers it would put you back ON; those numbers arriving is not the event
 * that makes the dial wrong.
 *
 * So it sits at the RADIO BINDING's position instead — with the line that says
 * which rig is being driven, which renders from the moment of the pick. Its
 * subject is the dial, not the pass. ONE control, ONE place: it is rendered
 * here and nowhere else, gated on the same hold `heldT` resolves (engine truth
 * first, local pick second) and on nothing more.
 *
 * Never present without a hold: with nothing held there is no pick to re-run,
 * and a button that picked "whatever looks right" would be choosing a
 * transponder — a choice of uplink — for the operator.
 *
 * Layout: content-height row in the arm bar, sharing the rail/binding box
 * treatment (ui-layout §2). */

      {/* ================= THE ARM BAR (2026-08-03 pass rebuild) =============
          Everything that says WHAT IS ARMED AND WHAT IT IS DRIVING, on one
          full-width row above both columns: the bird's identity, which rig is
          bound, the way back onto the dial, the five readiness gates, the live
          tracking badge and the ✕.

          WHY IT IS A ROW AND NOT A STACK. These were six separately-bordered
          blocks stacked down the 486-px detail column — 175 px of box for what
          is really one instrument, plus a 25 px sticky heading, in a column
          whose whole budget is 713 px. Spanning both columns they cost one
          wrapping row and hand the reclaimed height to the pass surfaces, which
          is the arithmetic that makes "no scrolling for normal operation"
          close at all. It is the FT8 console's merged `.cockpit-qso` strip
          applied here: nothing was deleted, the duplicated FRAMES were.

          AND IT RETIRES A CASCADE TRAP AT THE ROOT. The bird's name used to be
          `.sats-detail > h2`, whose descendant form out-cascaded `.log-entry h2`
          and pinned the wrong heading (styles.css:15086 records it). With the
          identity here there is no heading inside `.sats-detail` at all, and
          the log strip is no longer nested in that card either.

          RENDER CONDITION: a bird is open, OR a track is running. `selected ==
          null && track != null` is a real state — ✕ closes the detail and the
          track keeps running — and the badge is the way back in. */}

        <div className="sats-empty">

        /* THE PLANNING COLUMN — a bounded flex shell: the Next/Best strip
           (fit), the schedule (THE grower, and the section's one column-1
           scroll owner lives inside it), and the radio quadrant (fit) pinned
           to the bottom.

           WHY THE RADIO QUADRANT IS HERE AND NOT IN THE PASS COLUMN. Operator,
           2026-08-03: the frequencies and "the slections of what to select"
           belong on the first screen "as a prominent feature". `.sats-side`
           already spanned every row below the header, so capping the schedule
           on its own handed height to a column with nothing to spend it on —
           the reclaimed height had to be spent on a NAMED thing or the cap
           would rot. This is that thing, and it is what the automated-rotor
           operator watches while the mast looks after itself.

           IT ALSO BOUNDS THE SCHEDULE WITHOUT A PIXEL OR A ROW CAP. The
           schedule scroller keeps `flex: 1 1 auto` and no max-height at all
           (panel-overflow.test.ts's "the discovery band is bounded by ROW COUNT,
           never a pixel height" passes verbatim) — what stops it eating the page
           is the fit-content block underneath it in a bounded column, and the
           number of rows is set by the window rather than by a constant.

           MEASURED, because a round-1 comment here claimed "15 at the floor,
           more than 30 in portrait" and neither figure was ever produced: it is
           5 rows at the 1024×768 floor, 7–8 at 1366×768 and 1280×800, 16 at
           1920×1080, 24 in a 1200×1390 portrait and 30 at 3440×1440. The
           operator's "like the first 10 lines" arrives at about 900 px of window
           height. The per-size statement lives in the CHANGELOG and the guide;
           styles.css's `.sats-plan` comment carries the full table. */

            sat qso's. Lets not reinvent anything, logging sections exist in
            the phone area, can we drop that in?").

            Dropped in, not rebuilt: this is the SAME shared LogEntry the
            Phone and CW cockpits render, with the same props they pass, and
            it logs the SAME ORDINARY CONTACT they log. It is NOT a
            satellite-aware log — nothing about the bird reaches the record.
            Satellite tagging (ADIF PROP_MODE/SAT_NAME, which LoTW needs for
            satellite credit — BOTH: TQSL refuses to sign a record carrying
            only one of the pair, in either direction, so a half-tag costs
            the whole QSO, see `Engine::log_qso`) is NOT YET BUILT —
            deferred, not designed away; see the note line
            below, docs/guide/satellites.md and the CHANGELOG, all of which
            say so plainly so nobody waits on credit that isn't coming. Two
            further consequences of dropping in the shared strip UNCHANGED
            are documented in the guide rather than fixed here: during Field
            Day this strip logs to the ordinary log while the Phone and CW
            strips route to the contest log (App.tsx passes those two
            `fieldDay`; each cockpit then supplies its own literal `fdMode` —
            "PH" in PhoneCockpit, "CW" in CwCockpit — so wiring this section
            up means BOTH, and there is no third mode literal to reuse), and
            the recorded MODE is folded from the sideband, which is wrong on
            a digital tier (see `adifModeFromStation`).

            WHY IT IS A SIBLING OF `.sats-detail` AND NOT INSIDE IT — and
            this half is a BUG FIX, not a placement preference. LogEntry
            holds every field in its own local state, so while it was nested
            in `{selected && detail && …}` (SatellitesView.tsx:3194 before
            this change) hitting ✕, pressing Escape or clicking a different
            bird unmounted it and destroyed a half-typed contact. Mid-pass,
            between overs, that is the worst possible moment to lose a
            callsign. It now renders from `snap` alone — the operator's own
            radio state — so nothing about which bird is open, whether a
            track is armed, or whether AOS has happened can take the form
            away. `SatellitesView.remount.test.tsx` is the guard.

            WHY HERE IN THE COLUMN. Directly under the pass block: the sky
            dome and the pass timeline stay on screen while he types, and
            the frequencies and the transponder chooser are in the OTHER
            column entirely now, so nothing he needs mid-pass is behind the
            form. Below it is the Birds catalog, which is the section's one
            deliberately below-the-fold surface. No new scroller, no sticky,
            no fixed positioning: a plain in-flow block in the column that
            already owns the overflow. Document order is pinned by a test. */}
