 * The mid-rag-chew recall panel — a prominent "who is this + our history" card so the operator
 * can greet by name/QTH and pick the conversation back up. The identity header is surfaced big
 * (name · city · grid) for a quick glance; below it, a real list of prior contacts (date · band ·
 * mode · report · comment) gives durable relationship context, not just the last-QSO summary. Looks
 * complete with NO photo (initials avatar) — a QRZ photo is a later add-on, not a dependency.
 *
 * HISTORY OF THE `compact` VARIANT (0.18.0 → 2026-07-31, now deleted). The pre-overhaul cockpits
 * had no interposed scroller, so this card's height squeezed the operating panes directly the
 * moment 3 characters of a call were typed; 0.18.0 cut it to one line there, dropping the photo,
 * QTH, distance/bearing and note. The pane grid removed the mechanism: the cockpit log pane's
 * .pane-body is `flex:1; min-height:0; overflow:auto`, so a tall card scrolls inside the log
 * column and structurally cannot crush the cockpit — the operator asked for the full card back
 * (2026-07-31) and compact lost its last caller.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two lessons that must survive that deletion:
 *   - The previous-contacts list is a REAL list, never a "worked 3×" count (operator regression
 *     report, 2026-07-26): the question being asked on air is WHEN, on what BAND, and what did
 *     we exchange.
 *   - The list stays a BOUNDED internal scroller (.recall-log-list, fixed em ceiling): the pane
 *     body is the card's real scroller, and a nested full-length list fights it.
