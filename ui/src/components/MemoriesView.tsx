// Memories — the first-class saved-channel manager: repeaters, HF nets, calling
// freqs, POTA/SOTA watering holes. Groups + ★ favorites in a sidebar; a hybrid
// main pane (clean LIST with an inline editor by default, a CHIRP-style GRID on
// demand); one-click Tune (App's recallMemory applies freq + mode + shift + tone
// and auto-switches to the right cockpit); full CHIRP CSV round-trip so channels
// flow Nexus ⇄ CHIRP ⇄ real radios. Store + model live in features/memories.ts
// (shared with the cockpit MemoryStrip and the Program section's save).
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). Every operator-visible
// string comes from the catalog. What does NOT, because this screen is nearly all units: every
// dial and TX frequency, every offset, every CTCSS tone and DTCS code, the mode names and the
// mode/CTCSS pickers' choices, the callsign, the group names the operator typed, the HF and VHF/UHF
// section labels, the POTA/SOTA programme names, the `value` of every <select> (the label is
// prose, the value is what is stored), and the export FILE NAME's slug. The weekday
// abbreviations are date formatting rather than catalog prose — the same ruling the DXpedition
// calendar carries — and stay here with the rest of the schedule handling.

/**
 * Apply an operator-typed number, or do nothing at all.
 *
 * Every numeric field here used to commit a bare `Number(v)` (Greek-Windows report, 2026-08),
 * which is two bugs in one expression: `Number('145,5')` is `NaN` on any comma-decimal locale,
 * and — far worse — `Number('')` is `0`, so a rejected entry moved the channel to 0 MHz.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE DECIMAL FIELDS ARE `inputMode="decimal"`, NOT `type="number"`, AND THAT IS THE
 * ACTUAL FIX — DO NOT PUT `type="number"` BACK.** A number input never hands JavaScript what
 * the operator typed: the UA runs its own LOCALE-AWARE sanitisation first, and on a
 * comma-decimal locale `.` is the GROUP separator. So `14.074` typed into a number input on a
 * Greek/German Windows arrives at `.value` as `"14074"` — a valid number, a plausible number,
 * and a memory channel 14 GHz off frequency, with nothing for a guard to catch. Text with
 * `inputMode="decimal"` keeps the phone keypad and hands `parseOperatorNumber` the literal
 * characters, which is what the other three numeric sites in the app already do. `step` went
 * with the type; it is inert on a text input, and the spinner it drove was never the point.
 *
 * ⚠️ The `Number.isFinite` guard is NOT redundant with `coerceMemory`'s `posNum`. That rejects
 * a bad number, but for the OPTIONAL fields (`offsetMhz`, `txMhz`, `ctcssEncHz`, `dtcsCode`)
 * rejecting means the key is left off the rebuilt memory — so a fumbled edit did not fail, it
 * silently DELETED a repeater's offset or tone. Not committing at all leaves the stored value
 * where it was, and `CommitInput` snaps the draft back so the bad text never looks saved.
