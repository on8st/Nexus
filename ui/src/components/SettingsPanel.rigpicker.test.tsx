// The Rig-Model picker: the baud it may impose, and the screen-reader semantics that decided
// its design.
//
// FOUR ROUNDS OF THE BAUD RULE, and why the fifth is a different shape. Picking a rig imposes a
// CAT rate, and every round fixed the named radio and broke another: an FT-847 running 57,600
// clobbered to 4,800; the FX-4 (fixed 115,200) shipped unable to talk; three Kenwoods dead on a
// fresh install; and an IC-746 row reading `[9600, 19200]` against a manual offering
// 300/1200/4800/9600/19200/AUTO, which silently moved a 4,800 radio to 19,200 — the first bug
// again, created by the fix for the first bug. The cause was never the logic: it was 61 models
// of baud menus transcribed by hand out of hardware manuals. So the table now rests on one
// fact the backend states outright — `serial_rate_min == serial_rate_max` — and the first half
// of this file CHECKS IT AGAINST THAT FACT, from caps dumped by
// `scripts/gen-hamlib-serial-speeds.mjs` into `__fixtures__/hamlibSerialSpeeds.json`. A row
// transcribed from a manual cannot pass. Every rig that lost its entry keeps whatever baud is
// set, and `baud_ladder.rs` finds a working rate empirically instead.
//
// The second half guards the rig picker's ACCESSIBILITY, which decided its design: the QA
// pass wanted the `<select>` replaced by an input + `<datalist>` so a name could be typed.
// JAWS does not announce a datalist-backed input the way it announces a `<select>` (the
// suggestion popup is browser chrome, not DOM — Chromium/WebView2 never puts it on the IA2
// bridge JAWS reads), and a11y here is always-on, never a mode. So the control of record
// stays a native `<select>` and searchability arrives as a filter field beside it. These
// tests are what stops that being quietly undone.
