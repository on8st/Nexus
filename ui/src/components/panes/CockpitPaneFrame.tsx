// THE COCKPIT PANE FRAME — Connect's PaneFrame (components/connect/PaneFrame.tsx),
// promoted so every cockpit's operator-content blocks render through one box.
//
// It reuses the SHIPPED .pane-frame / .pane-head / .pane-body CSS family verbatim
// (styles.css ~1497): a bounded frame whose body is `flex:1; min-height:0; overflow:auto`
// with the thin visible scrollbar. That family is view-agnostic and already carries
// Connect's panes; it is deliberately NOT forked or edited here, and cockpit-panes.test.ts
// fails if this rebuild starts restyling it.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT have:
//   - no `className` / `style` prop. A pane must declare no size of its own — the grid cell
//     sizes the frame (design3 §5 contract rule 2). Without a styling hook on the frame,
//     "just give this pane a min-height" is not expressible; content styling attaches
//     inside the body, where it can only ever scroll.
//   - no picker. Connect's slot picker belongs to Connect's assignable grid; a cockpit's
//     placement is the fixed responsive template, and visibility is the ⊞ Panels menu.
//
// TX-safety: this is a layout wrapper and nothing more. The operator must never be unable
// to stop a transmission, so his last resort (PTT, abort, Tune, Stop TX) does not render
// through it — it lives in the shell's pinned .cockpit-txdock or the header, with no id in
// any pane vocabulary. A TRANSMITTING pane may sit in a frame and several do (Phone's voice
// keyer; Operate's Tx messages and its decode/roster panes, which use raw .panel divs but
// answer to the same rule): being a sender has no bearing on whether a pane may be hidden.
// See cockpit-panes.css, "THE STOP LINE".
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). The pane's own NAME
// arrives from the cockpit and is interpolated as data; the two head buttons' words are here.

   *  every strip a grower, and a one-row chip strip inflated to half a column of empty
   *  panel (operator, 2026-07-31). Omitted = FILL: the pane splits the column's remaining
   *  height with its fill siblings by `weight`. Both are PLACEMENT inputs carried inline
   *  from typed props — the column sizes the frame; a pane still cannot size itself, so
   *  contract rule 2 (no min-height/flex/overflow of a pane's own) holds. At the 1-col
   *  scrolling tier the region's --cockpit-pane-flex overrides fill to content-height.
   *  The fill min-height consults --cockpit-fill-min (default 0): the REGION-LESS
   *  cockpits (RTTY/SSTV — bare fill frames, no .cockpit-panes) set it on their shell
   *  rule so the frame keeps a floor under the shell's scrolling deficit valve. A sheet
   *  rule on .pane-frame cannot supply that floor — this inline declaration outranks
   *  every selector (the point of inline placement), which is exactly how
   *  `.rtty-cockpit > .pane-frame { min-height: 10em }` once shipped dead. The knob is
   *  fenced to those two shell rules by cockpit-panes.test.ts: inherited into a
   *  region's tier-2/3 `overflow: hidden` it would be the clip bug reborn. */
