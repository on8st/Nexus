// ★ FAVORITES IS THE COCKPIT STRIP, WRITTEN DOWN — so it is a FLAT, RANK-NUMBERED list
// and its ▲▼ move a RANK.
//
// Two things made the ★ view unable to answer "what is on my strip, and in what order":
//
//   1. ▲▼ were gated to `sel === 'all'`, so under ★ there was no reorder control at all
//      — and the verb behind them (`moveMemory`) swaps MASTER-ARRAY neighbours. Under ★
//      the rows shown are the master array FILTERED, so two visually adjacent rows can be
//      20 slots apart: one press swaps a star with a non-favorite and nothing visible
//      moves. `moveFavorite` swaps the star with the previous/next STAR instead.
//   2. The list was band-sectioned (HF / VHF-UHF) and sortable. Both re-order the rows
//      away from the master order the strip and Ctrl+1..9 actually read, so the list
//      showed a truthful set in a misleading order. Under ★ the order IS the meaning:
//      row n is chip n.
//
// The rank numbers are what makes the cap legible — 1..STRIP_FAVORITE_LIMIT are the chips
// the cockpit header shows, the rest are starred but off the strip.
