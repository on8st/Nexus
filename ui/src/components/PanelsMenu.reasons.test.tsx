//
// ⊞ PANELS — AN ENTRY THAT SHOWS NOTHING SAYS WHY, AND STAYS THE OPERATOR'S (operator,
// 2026-08-03: "what do the Panels selection / deselection of Rig Scope Controls and TX
// meters do on the Phone tab? I don't see them anywhere on my screen whether enabled or
// disabled").
//
// Eight entries across Phone and CW offer a pane that can be empty or absent through no
// fault of the tick:
//   - Rig Scope Controls / CW's Scope Controls mount ONLY while the radio's own
//     panadapter streams (native Icom CI-V or FlexRadio).
//   - Phone's DSP Functions / RX DSP Levels and CW's DSP Toggles / RX DSP Levels are
//     capability-gated on what the rig reports over CAT.
//   - CW's Sent Echo holds this SESSION's transmissions, so it is empty at every start-up.
//   - TX Meters gate correctly, but the unpinned variant renders nothing on receive.
//
// TWO IDEAS, NOT ONE. The REASON explains why nothing is on screen right now. The
// CHECKBOX is the operator's PREFERENCE about that panel. Merging them — refusing the
// tick while the station cannot feed the pane — took his control away in the state he is
// most likely to want it: CW's Sent Echo is empty at EVERY session start, and unticking it
// there is exactly how an operator who does not want the echo gets rid of it for the
// session. It also dimmed the focus ring of the one entry that most needs to be reachable.
// So every one of these entries is a plain, operable checkbox that carries its reason.
//
// This suite RENDERS the real cockpits (the wiring, not a props fixture) in BOTH states and
// asserts both halves: the reason arrives as the checkbox's accessible description when the
// pane has nothing to show, no reason when it has, and the tick RECORDS — and keeps — the
// operator's preference across the moment the station starts feeding it. A presence test on
// a source string would pass against a menu that never received the reason at all.
