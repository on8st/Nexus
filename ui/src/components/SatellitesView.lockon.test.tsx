// LOCK ON — the way back onto the bird after the dial gets away from you.
//
// Operator report: "should we introduce a button to lock on to the implied frequency if I move
// the dial on my own?" A knob move INSIDE the passband is already adopted as your position and
// the uplink mirrors it. What had no way back was leaving the passband — by hand, or because the
// rig came back somewhere else — after which the dial is somewhere the pass does not describe.
//
// The transponder cards could not fix it either: they are radio inputs, and clicking the one
// already selected fires no change event. The pick that would re-assert routing, band, mode and
// both legs was literally unreachable while it was the pick in force.
//
// What is pinned here:
//
//  - The button RE-RUNS THE HELD PICK — the same command, the same name, the same index. It is
//    not a second frequency-writing path: routing, the band, the commanded mode and the split
//    all come along, which they would not if this shoved a dial at the rig directly.
//  - It appears only where there is a pick to re-assert. A button that re-picked "whatever looks
//    right" would be choosing a transponder for the operator.
//  - REACHABILITY IS THE POINT, and it is what shipped wrong twice. The operator reported "I
//    can't see it" against two different gates. The second was placement: the button lived in
//    the Doppler readout's HEAD, which renders only once a track is armed AND Doppler has
//    reported a tuning — i.e. from AOS onward. So the way back did not exist in the two states
//    where the dial most often gets away from you: a pick made with no pass armed (that pick
//    tunes the radio immediately), and an armed pass waiting for AOS.
//
// Every state below is RENDERED and asserted, not reasoned about. That is the whole reason this
// file grew: twice the gate was argued from the source and twice the operator saw nothing.
