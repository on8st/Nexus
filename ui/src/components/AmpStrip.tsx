/**
 * The amplifier's own controls, in every cockpit header that has an amplifier behind it.
 *
 * ⛔ NONE OF THIS IS A STOP CONTROL, and it must never be added to a cockpit's stop-line
 * census. Putting an amplifier in standby does NOT end a transmission — the exciter keeps
 * keying and the drive passes straight through — so a control that looks like a kill switch
 * and is not one is worse than no control at all.
 *
 * Three properties this component exists to hold:
 *
 * 1. **Invisible unless an amplifier is configured.** `amp == null` renders nothing, which is
 *    the state of almost every station. Same rule the Connect pane follows.
 * 2. **Operate is driven by the AMPLIFIER, never by what we just sent.** `OPERATE` is a toggle
 *    with no idempotent "set" in the protocol, so a lost or duplicated frame inverts it. The
 *    chip reads `amp.operate` from the last status frame and nothing else; clicking sets no
 *    local state and the next poll (≤1 s) is what moves it.
 * 3. **Disabled while keyed.** Stepping band under drive pits relays and can take a PA out.
 *    This disabling is a COURTESY, not the protection — the poll thread refuses to send while
 *    the amplifier reports transmitting, and that is what actually guards the hardware.
