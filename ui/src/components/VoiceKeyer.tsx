 * else about it bears on that: not that it transmits (six panes do), not that it hosts this
 * button (two do), not that its unmount cleanup is itself a stop. The cleanup below is not

  // LINE) — it is why the entry carries a warning: a stop the operator did not ask for is
  // indistinguishable from a dropout.
  //
  // The two teardowns are not the same act, and the second one is DESTRUCTIVE:
  //   · stopVoice ends a message that is playing. Cleanup, not safety — the operator could
  //     have stopped it from the dock either way — but it is an over cut short, so it speaks.
  //   · cancelVoiceRecording DISCARDS an in-progress capture (lib.rs: take + drop the
  //     buffer). Nothing about hiding a pane implies "throw away the recording I am making",
  //     so it may not happen silently. It still has to happen — leaving the recorder running
  //     puts its only Stop & save button off-screen, and saving instead would overwrite the

  // The ⊞ entry names both before the tick (VOICE_KEYER_STOPS_ON_HIDE, and
  // VOICE_KEYER_UNDO_ENDS on the menu's other hide path), and this names them after, for the
  // operator who walked off the Phone screen and never opened a menu at all.

  // BOTH announcements are CONDITIONAL ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, in opposite directions
  // from where they started. The over used to end in silence — the same argument that says a
  // binned recording must be announced says an aborted transmission must be, and it is the
  // louder of the two. And the discard used to be announced unconditionally while
  // cancelVoiceRecording's rejection was swallowed, which told the operator his take was
