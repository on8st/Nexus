// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE **MIGRATED** LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts): the wide graph's
// prose — its heading, the gesture hint, the zoom/gain/zero controls, the scroll, 3D, pause and
// pop-out buttons, the canvas and the legend — is in the catalog under `waterfall.*`. It is an
// INSTRUMENT: its gestures set the RX and TX audio offsets, and it holds no transmit control.
//
// The units rule lands on the SPECTRUM: every span in kHz, the `dBr` legend and its ticks, the
// frequency axis and the scrollback time tape drawn into the bitmap, and the RX/TX marker names
// are measurements and tokens, so they stay in the code — as do the zoom LABELS, which live in
// `waterfall.ts` and are not this batch's file. The one thing drawn on the canvas that IS prose
// is the paused chip, and it comes from the catalog.
