//
// LOGGING A CONTACT FROM THE SATELLITES SECTION.
//
// Operator, 0.27.3, after a clean pass with the manual rotor: "the problem came
// when I tried to log someone, as I dont have a spot to log within the
// satellites section to log my sat qso's. Lets not reinvent anything, logging
// sections exist in the phone area, can we drop that in?"
//
// Three claims are pinned here:
//
//  1. The section renders the SHARED `LogEntry` — the same component the Phone
//     and CW cockpits use — not a second log panel. A copy is exactly the thing
//     the operator asked us not to build.
//  2. It sits in the one `.sats-side` scroller, hard against the Doppler
//     readout and AHEAD of the transponder cards and the globe, because an
//     operator turning a rotator by hand has seconds between overs and will not
//     scroll a column past two full-height graphics to reach a form. Asserted
//     as DOCUMENT ORDER, which is his scroll order.
//  3. What reaches `logQso` is an ORDINARY CONTACT. No `propMode`, no
//     `satName`, nothing derived from the bird — satellite tagging is not done
//     yet, and a QSO record is permanent. Asserting on the RECORD, never on
//     what the panel displays: the display is not what LoTW reads.
