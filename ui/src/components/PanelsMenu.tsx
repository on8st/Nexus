// The ⊞ Panels control — the ONLY way to remove or restore a cockpit panel. A
// persistent ✕ on every panel header was considered and rejected: it would sit inches
// from a decode list the operator clicks all night, with no confirm, and hover-reveal
// would break the always-on accessibility posture. Removal is menu-only, keyboard
// reachable, and never more than one click from Undo / Reset — both ship here, before
// the operator can make a mess.
//
// Only the panels the CURRENT layout renders are listed. Every cockpit keeps at least one
// control that STOPS a transmission outside every pane this menu can reach — Stop TX and PTT
// everywhere they exist, Tune for its own carrier, the dock aborts, and the TX-enable latch in
// RTTY and SSTV, where a disarm really does abort the over (it does not in Operate; see
// features/panelState, THE STOP LINE, for the per-cockpit census). None of them has an entry
// here by construction. An entry can cost you a sender, and
// it can cost you a stop control a PANE happens to host (Phone's voice keyer holds a ■ Stop,
// RTTY's decode pane holds the Auto toggle) — what it can never cost you is the way to shut a
// transmission up, because that lives where no tick reaches. Senders ARE listed, six of them:
// Operate's Tx messages, its two decode panes and two rosters, Phone's voice keyer. That is
// the rule holding, not a hole in it.
//
// A listed pane whose hide ENDS something in flight carries a `note` saying what the tick
// ends. That is courtesy rather than the safety rule (a stop the operator did not ask for
// reads as a dropout), and it is required of exactly those panes — a note on an entry whose
// hide ends nothing teaches him to ignore the next one.
//
// THE TICK IS NOT THE ONLY BUTTON IN THIS MENU THAT HIDES A PANE. "Undo last change"
// restores the layout as it was before the last change, and when that layout had such a pane
// unticked, pressing it unmounts it exactly as a tick does — so it carries the same
// consequence line, in the same words, before the press (`undoNote`). "Reset layout" does
// not need one: it applies the empty record, and an absent state means 'docked', so reset
// can only ever put panes back.
//
// Some panels are conditional on the station (rig-scope controls need the radio's own
// panadapter streaming; the DSP panes need the rig to report those fields over CAT; CW's
// Sent Echo is empty until the first over), so an operator can tick one and see nothing
// happen. A `note` answers that: the entry says, in its own accessible description, why
// there is nothing on screen for it right now and what would change that.
//
// THE NOTE EXPLAINS; IT NEVER REFUSES. Availability and preference are two questions and
// this menu only asks one of them: "do you want this panel?" A round of this shipped with
// unavailable entries `aria-disabled` and the toggle suppressed, which conflated them and
// cost the operator control in the state he is most likely to exercise it — CW's Sent Echo
// is empty at EVERY session start, so an operator who wants it gone had to wait for a
// transmission before he could untick it. Recording the preference now is also the honest
// answer: it takes effect the moment the pane can mount. And the greyed look that came with
// aria-disabled was `opacity` on the focusable element, which composites its FOCUS RING too
// — the change made to keep the entry keyboard-reachable is what made its focus indicator
// hard to see. Both problems are deleted, not worked around, by leaving the box alone.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). The ENTRIES are not
// its words: each cockpit names its own panels and supplies the `label` and the `note`, so
// those move with the cockpit. What is here is the menu itself — the ⊞ button, the popover,
// the popped-out tag, and Undo / Reset. No vocabulary ID passes through this file as prose,
// so nothing here can rename one.
