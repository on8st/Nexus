// THE AGC CHIP MUST NEVER CLAIM A SPEED THE RADIO NEVER TOOK.
//
// Operator report (2026-08-13): "In CW mode, AGC changes for F-M-S work slowly or not at all."
// The rig-side half of that lives in `crates/tempo-audio/src/service.rs` (a pick now forces the
// write past the loop's what-we-last-wrote dedupe, and a refused step stops being re-sent). This
// suite pins the cockpit's half.
//
// `snap.radio.agc` is the rig READ-BACK — it lags up to a heavy poll (750 ms) behind the click,
// so the chip has to be optimistic or the operator clicks into a control that does not respond.
// The old mirror was a `useState` + a `useEffect` keyed on `snap.radio.agc`, and that effect
// only runs when the VALUE CHANGES. On a refusal the value never changes: Hamlib carries AGC as
// an enum (OFF/SUPERFAST/FAST/SLOW/USER/MEDIUM/AUTO) and backends do not all implement every
// step — MEDIUM least of all — so `L AGC 5` comes back `RPRT -1`, the rig stays where it was,
// and the read-back keeps reporting the OLD speed. The mirror therefore lit Mid forever on a
// radio still running Fast: the app believing it applied, which is the one thing it must not do.
//
// The chip is now DERIVED — the pick shows until the snapshot NAMES it as refused — so there is
// no remembered state to go stale, and both directions are asserted here.
