  // ONE .cockpit-panes grid; the ⊞ Panels 'removed' gating is unchanged (shown()).
  //
  // "TX CHROME NEVER ENTERS THE REGION" USED TO BE WRITTEN HERE AND IS FALSE: the voiceKeyer
  // pane transmits (F1–F6 key the rig) and hosts a ■ Stop of its own, and it renders inside
  // .cockpit-panes with a ⊞ id. What is true is THE STOP LINE (features/panelState.ts): the
  // controls this cockpit's census rests on stay out of the region — the PTT row lives in the
  // pinned .cockpit-txdock, Stop TX and Tune in the header — and none of them has an id in the
  // pane vocabulary, so moving or hiding one is unrepresentable. Whether a pane transmits has
  // no bearing on whether it may be hidden.
  //
  // DSP funcs: only those the rig actually reports (non-null) render — capability-gated,
  // no dead buttons. STICKY ONCE SEEN: `null` means BOTH "this rig lacks the func" and
  // "we don't know right now", and the radio loop clears every reading to null on a CAT
  // re-confirmation — which a QSY triggers. Gating purely on the live value therefore
  // made the whole DSP group vanish the moment you clicked a spot, the region reflow,
  // and Band Activity jump (operator report 2026-07-25). Once a rig has reported a func
  // we keep showing it; a rig that never reports one still shows nothing.
  // Learned only while the pane is SHOWN — the ⊞-hidden state must not keep learning
  // (that is the pre-rebuild behaviour: re-showing a hidden pane renders what it knew
  // when it was hidden, and nothing else silently widens the column budget meanwhile).
  const liveDspFuncs = DSP_FUNCS.filter((f) => snap.radio[f.key] != null)
  // Whether each rig-gated pane CAN render at all on this station, independent of the ⊞
  // tick. Computed here, above the menu, so the entry's note and the pane read ONE boolean
  // each and cannot drift apart — which is the whole failure the notes exist to answer.
  // CAPABILITY, not the learned flag: the sticky learns just below only run while the pane
  // is SHOWN, so keying availability off the ref alone would leave an operator who unticked
  // before the rig first reported stuck with a dead entry once it does.

  // host is only supplying `shown` + the menu items.
  //
  // Five notes, of two different kinds — see panelHost's `notes` doc, which is why they
  // share one field.
  //
  // FOUR ARE "nothing on screen behind this box" — the dead-checkbox the operator hit on
  // 2026-08-03. Three of those are conditional on the STATION and clear by themselves the
  // moment the rig can feed them: the rig-scope pane needs the RADIO's own panadapter
  // streaming, and the two DSP panes need the rig to report those fields over CAT (the same
  // capability gate the DSP row itself has always applied to its buttons). The fourth, TX
  // Meters, mounts fine and reads only while keyed.
  //
  // THE FIFTH IS A CONSEQUENCE. Unticking Voice Keyer ends a message and discards a
  // recording. Not the price of its being hideable — nothing had to buy that (THE STOP LINE:
  // neither being a sender nor hosting a ■ Stop of its own has any bearing on it) — but a
  // stop the operator did not ask for reads as a dropout, so it is said before the tick.
  // That note is required, not decorative:
  // PhoneCockpit.keyerHide.test.tsx hides every id here, asks the wire which hides stopped
  // something, and requires exactly those entries to carry one. The menu's Undo button
  // reaches the same hide and carries the same consequence (VOICE_KEYER_UNDO_ENDS); Reset
  // cannot reach it at all.

  // the fourth forbade the entry for hiding one — and both were wrong the same way.

          unchanged — header, scope, ONE pane region, TX dock — one of the four is simply
          conditional now, exactly as Operate's waterfall has been since 0.15.0. The gate is
          HERE, at the shell child, and not inside the section: a scope that rendered an empty
          `.ph-scope-panel` would keep its `flex: 0 1 22%` basis and its 8em floor and hand the
          operator back a bordered empty box instead of the height he asked to reclaim.
          `.cockpit-panes` is `flex: 1 1 0` (cockpit-panes.css) — the region IS the sink, so
          the freed height goes to the panes with no rule change.

          The Splitter goes with it. It drags `--ph-scope-h`, the strip's flex basis, so on its
          own it is a grab handle for something that is not there — and it is a shell child of
          its own, which would leave a stranded 8px seam between the header and the region.
          The var it wrote is untouched and still stored, so re-ticking restores the height he
          dragged to rather than the 22% default.

          Nothing on this strip stops a transmission (THE STOP LINE, features/panelState.ts):
          it is a display plus click-to-tune, and Stop TX / Tune are in the header above, PTT in

          useRegionCols OWNS data-cols (measured from the region itself, stamped
          imperatively — never rendered here); the JSX renders exactly as many
          .cockpit-col groups as the tier: at 1 the two-column grouping simply stacks and
          the region is the scroller; at 2 it is band+keyer+aux | log; at 3 the aux
          strips take their own middle column. Columns are implicit-row grids, so a pane
          hidden from ⊞ Panels leaves no empty cell behind — and when the ⊞ menu empties
          the LEADING column outright (possible only since the keyer gained an entry), the
          column itself is not rendered and maxCols collapses to 1 with it, so a bounded
          tier never holds a track with nothing in it.

          The columns are KEYED, and the log + keyer keep the same key at every tier: a
          tier flip that moved a pane to a different column div would UNMOUNT it (React
          cannot carry a fiber across a parent change — keys on the pane don't help,
          only a stable parent does). For LogEntry that wiped every in-progress QSO
          field mid-flip; for VoiceKeyer it aborted an in-flight voice TX. So the keyer
          stays in the leading column at 3-col too — a deliberate deviation from
          design3 §2's "keyer in col 2" grouping, because fiber stability for a
          TX-capable pane outranks the grouping aesthetic (fix-round D1, 2026-07-31;
          guarded by PhoneCockpit.structure.test.tsx). Aux strips still change columns
          on a 2↔3 flip and do remount — they hold no local state (their sliders bind
          to cockpit state), so that residual is harmless and accepted. */}
