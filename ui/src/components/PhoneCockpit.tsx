// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE **PARTIAL** LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts), and for one
// reason only: THE PTT ROW, the pinned dock row this cockpit's stop line rests on, is still
// written in English here — the button's four labels (which ARE the accessible name
// components/stop-line.test.tsx matches), its three-armed tooltip, the Lock toggle that
// decides whether the Space bar is a stop at all, and the Field Day exchange chip that
// shares the row. It moves in the transmit-path batch, with the stop-line sweeps re-run.
// Everything else is in the catalog under `phone.*` — the refusal TOASTS that row raises
// included, a toast being neither a control nor anything a sweep can see. Every dial
// reading, split offset, filter and scope width, reference level, percentage, band and mode
// name and the rig's own group plates (DSP, NR, AGC, BW, REC, SPLIT) are invariant tokens
// and stay in the code.

  // pinned .cockpit-txdock, Stop TX and Tune in the header — and none of them has an id in the

  // no bearing on whether it may be hidden.
  //
  // DSP funcs: only those the rig actually reports (non-null) render — capability-gated,
  // no dead buttons. STICKY ONCE SEEN: `null` means BOTH "this rig lacks the func" and
  // "we don't know right now", and the radio loop clears every reading to null on a CAT
  // re-confirmation — which a QSY triggers. Gating purely on the live value therefore

  // we keep showing it; a rig that never reports one still shows nothing.
  // Learned only while the pane is SHOWN — the ⊞-hidden state must not keep learning

  // FOUR ARE "nothing on screen behind this box" — the dead-checkbox the operator hit on

  // moment the rig can feed them: the rig-scope pane needs the RADIO's own panadapter
  // streaming, and the two DSP panes need the rig to report those fields over CAT (the same
  // capability gate the DSP row itself has always applied to its buttons). The fourth, TX
  // Meters, mounts fine and reads only while keyed.
  //
  // THE FIFTH IS A CONSEQUENCE. Unticking Voice Keyer ends a message and discards a
  // recording. Not the price of its being hideable — nothing had to buy that (THE STOP LINE:
  // neither being a sender nor hosting a ■ Stop of its own has any bearing on it) — but a

      {/* THE SCOPE STRIP, ⊞-hideable since 2026-08-16. The shell's four-child census is
          unchanged — header, scope, ONE pane region, TX dock — one of the four is simply
          conditional now, exactly as Operate's waterfall has been since 0.15.0. The gate is
          HERE, at the shell child, and not inside the section: a scope that rendered an empty
          `.ph-scope-panel` would keep its `flex: 0 1 22%` basis and its 8em floor and hand the
          operator back a bordered empty box instead of the height he asked to reclaim.
          `.cockpit-panes` is `flex: 1 1 0` (cockpit-panes.css) — the region IS the sink, so
          the freed height goes to the panes with no rule change.

          The Splitter goes with it. It drags `--ph-scope-h`, the strip's flex basis, so on its
          own it is a grab handle for something that is not there — and it is a shell child of
          its own, which would leave a stranded 8px seam between the header and the region.
          The var it wrote is untouched and still stored, so re-ticking restores the height he
          dragged to rather than the 22% default.

          Nothing on this strip stops a transmission (THE STOP LINE, features/panelState.ts):
          it is a display plus click-to-tune, and Stop TX / Tune are in the header above, PTT in
          the dock below, none of them reachable from the ⊞ menu. */}

          useRegionCols OWNS data-cols (measured from the region itself, stamped
          imperatively — never rendered here); the JSX renders exactly as many
          .cockpit-col groups as the tier: at 1 the two-column grouping simply stacks and
          the region is the scroller; at 2 it is band+keyer+aux | log; at 3 the aux
          strips take their own middle column. Columns are implicit-row grids, so a pane
          hidden from ⊞ Panels leaves no empty cell behind — and when the ⊞ menu empties
          the LEADING column outright (possible only since the keyer gained an entry), the
          column itself is not rendered and maxCols collapses to 1 with it, so a bounded
          tier never holds a track with nothing in it.

          The columns are KEYED, and the log + keyer keep the same key at every tier: a
          tier flip that moved a pane to a different column div would UNMOUNT it (React
          cannot carry a fiber across a parent change — keys on the pane don't help,
          only a stable parent does). For LogEntry that wiped every in-progress QSO
          field mid-flip; for VoiceKeyer it aborted an in-flight voice TX. So the keyer
          stays in the leading column at 3-col too — a deliberate deviation from
          design3 §2's "keyer in col 2" grouping, because fiber stability for a
          TX-capable pane outranks the grouping aesthetic (fix-round D1, 2026-07-31;
          guarded by PhoneCockpit.structure.test.tsx). Aux strips still change columns
          on a 2↔3 flip and do remount — they hold no local state (their sliders bind
          to cockpit state), so that residual is harmless and accepted. */}
