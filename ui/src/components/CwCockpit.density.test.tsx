// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// THE CW COCKPIT EXISTS FOR THE DECODE WINDOW, AND AT THE DEFAULT WINDOW IT HAD ~3 LINES.
//
// THE DEFECT. DECODE is declared `weight={3}` — the primary pane — but at the shipped default
// window the region is tier 2 (classifyRegionCols: 1200x750 at the fitter's 80% ⇒ region
// ~1470), which puts EVERY aux pane in DECODE's own column. Five `fit="content"` siblings are
// `flex: 0 0 auto`, i.e. unshrinkable, so the one grower in the column is the only child that
// can pay for the overflow: DECODE collapses to its `--cockpit-fill-min` floor and the column
// scrolls the rest. (Before d266d3aa it clipped instead. The scroller and the floor are that
// commit's; this file is about how much is left to scroll PAST.)
//
// WHAT THIS FILE PINS, and it is one number twice: the leading column's UNSHRINKABLE stack,
// and the transcript DECODE gets inside its floor. Everything this pass deletes is chrome that
// says what the pane frame already says once:
//   · SENT's `.cw-decode-head` — one span reading "SENT ▲" under a frame head reading "Sent".
//   · DECODE's `.cw-decode-head` — a row whose first span reads "DECODE" under a frame head
//     reading "Decode"; the rest of it (AI badge, WPM, the AI switch, status, Clear) moves to
//     the frame head's action cluster, which was rendering EMPTY.
//   · Two whole pane frames: the three rig-control strips are 3 x [head + body padding +
//     border + gap] wrapped around one row of chips each, so they merge into ONE "Rig
//     controls" frame whose body is one wrapping strip.
// NOT this pass's, but verified HERE because CW is its second host: `.pane-body > .bandstrip`
// (the card-in-card flatten landed by the Phone density pass, 8b38ff77). It is keyed on the
// FRAME, so it reaches CW's Band Activity too — and a frame-keyed rule is exactly the kind
// whose second host nobody checks. Its 34px is the Phone pass's win, not this file's: the
// baseline below is measured against 8b38ff77, with that flatten already in.
//
// HOW THIS GUARD COMPUTES. Same split as LogEntry.density.test.tsx, same engine
// (cssCascade.testkit):
//   · COMPUTED, live, from the real sheets through the real cascade on the real rendered tree:
//     every border / padding / margin / min-height / line box of every CHROME box this pass
//     touches, and the NUMBER of frames in the column. Those are the terms that move.
//   · CALIBRATED, and inert: PANE_CONTENT — the inner row each aux pane wraps around. This
//     pass changes none of them, so each is carried as one measured constant (the 2026-08-04
//     browser measurement of the pane's outer height at the default window, minus the chrome
//     computed here). Ballast: it cannot detect anything.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE. No pixel here is verified against a layout engine, and the merged
// rig strip is asserted to be ONE row only in the sense that the DOM has one wrapping
// container — whether it actually wraps at the tier-2 column width is a browser fact. If it
// wraps to two rows the win is ~28px smaller than modelled and RIG_STRIP is the constant to
// re-measure. Re-measure it; do not nudge it.
