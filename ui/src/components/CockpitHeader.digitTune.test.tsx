// ONE WHEEL EVENT ⇒ ONE CHANGE, on the shared main dial.
//
// THE HAZARD THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. `CockpitHeader` already attaches a NATIVE, non-passive wheel
// listener to `.ch-readout` (useWheelTune), and the per-digit hit regions live INSIDE that
// element. Any handler on a digit therefore sees an event that also bubbles to the hook. Measured
// on a probe before this was built: a digit listener without `stopPropagation` moved the dial
// twice (`setFrequency` calls `[14.075, 14.0741]`) and, because the backend is latest-wins, the
// DIGIT's 1 kHz was the one silently discarded. A React `onWheel` on the digit cannot fix it —
// React 18 delegates to the render root, so the ancestor's native listener has already run, and
// React's wheel listener is passive so it cannot `preventDefault` either. Both halves fail
// quietly, and each component looks correct in isolation.
//
// THE SHAPE THAT MAKES IT UNREPRESENTABLE: there is still exactly ONE listener, ONE accumulator,
// ONE optimistic target and ONE flush. The digit under the pointer only chooses the STEP for that
// event (`resolveStepHz`). Nothing was removed — the step selector still drives the nudge buttons
// and the scope wheel, and wheeling a NON-digit part of the readout still uses it.
//
// All six main dials (Operate, Phone, CW, RTTY, SSTV, Tempo) render through this one component,
// so every assertion here covers all six. Tempo was added last and is the reason to say the count
// out loud: it rendered this header for months WITHOUT `digitTune`, and nothing here could see
// that — this file proves the mechanism, never that a given cockpit asked for it. What each
// cockpit passes is pinned where that cockpit is (see `TempoHeader.digitTune.test.tsx`).
