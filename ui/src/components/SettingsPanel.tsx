/**
 * The single CAT rate a rig can run — for the rigs whose Hamlib backend states it as a fact.
 *
 * ## THE BASIS RULE. An entry may rest on ONE fact, and this is it.
 *
 * A model is listed **only** when `rigctl -m <model> --dump-caps` against the bundled Hamlib
 * reports `Serial speed: N..N` — `serial_rate_min == serial_rate_max`, the backend saying there
 * is no choice of rate at all. The value is that N. Nothing else may put a rig in this table:
 * not a baud menu out of the radio's manual, not a low declared max, not a make.
 *
 * Picking such a rig sets the baud to N, because on a one-rate rig every other value is a
 * setting that cannot work. There is nothing to protect and so no judgement to get wrong.
 *
 * A rig with **no entry keeps whatever baud is set** and is never touched. Finding a working
 * rate for those is `baud_ladder.rs`'s job — it PROBES, and a probe cannot be wrong about a
 * radio the way a table can.
 *
 * ### Why the rule is this narrow — four rounds, each fixing the last one's rig and breaking a new one
 *
 * The predecessor of this table carried a per-radio `{rates, preferred}` transcribed out of
 * hardware manuals across 61 models, and it clobbered a working setting every round:
 * an FT-847 running 57,600 rewritten to 4,800; an FX-4 (fixed 115,200) shipped unable to talk;
 * three Kenwoods dead on a fresh install; and finally an IC-746 row reading `[9600, 19200]`
 * against a manual (Set Mode item 27) that offers 300/1200/4800/9600/19200/AUTO — so an
 * operator running one at 4,800 was silently moved to 19,200, which is the FT-847 bug again,
 * created by the fix for the FT-847 bug.
 *
 * **The root cause was the data, not the logic.** Hand transcription across 61 models has a
 * failure rate, and each wrong row silently overwrites a radio that was working. So the table
 * now holds only what the backend declares, and is checked against it: the caps of every rig
 * the picker offers are dumped by `scripts/gen-hamlib-serial-speeds.mjs` into
 * `__fixtures__/hamlibSerialSpeeds.json`, and `SettingsPanel.rigpicker.test.tsx` fails if a row
 * appears whose model is not `min == max` there, if its rate is not that value, or if a
 * one-rate rig in the catalog is missing a row. **A row cannot be added from a manual.**
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT here, and it stays that way: rigs whose declared max is merely low.
 * Hamlib does not enforce `serial_rate_min`/`_max` — measured, model 3085 opens clean at
 * 115,200 against a declared max of 19,200 — and Nexus drives Icoms past it on purpose (the
 * native CI-V scope REQUIRES 115,200 on an IC-705, and `civ/scope.rs` records an IC-9700
 * verified at 57,600 against a declared 38,400). Only `min == max` is a fact; a range is not.

                      ⚠️ THIS SENTENCE HAS BEEN WRONG TWICE. It first said TCI was "a WebSocket
                      protocol Nexus can't drive" (false — Hamlib has a TCI backend). It was then
                      rewritten to send the operator to model 7, on the evidence that
                      `strings libhamlib-4.dll` contains `tci1x.c`. That does not follow, and it
                      was checked the wrong way: source strings can be present while the backend
                      is not registered in the build. Measured on the real delivery path —
                        rigctld.exe -m 7 -r 127.0.0.1:50001  ->  "Unknown rig num 7, or

                      while `-m 1` starts fine, and `rigctl -l` lists no TCI/Expert/SunSDR entry
                      at all. Model 7 was removed from the catalog (2026-08-06); pointing anyone
                      at it was pointing them at a daemon that refuses to start.

                      The check that settles this class is one command: start rigctld on the
                      model and see whether it does. Do not infer a backend from a grep. */}

                  Correct if your transmit audio goes in the <strong>microphone</strong> path, as
                  with an interface wired to the mic jack (some RIGblaster models) — or if you
                  simply prefer plain USB to the DATA submode (for its wider receive passband, say)
                  and your rig is set to send its USB-codec audio in SSB, which on many modern rigs
                  (FT-991A, IC-7300 and the like) is a single menu item. Either way the rig has to
                  put the audio you're feeding onto the air in plain SSB: where it does not — the
                  codec feeds only the data port and nothing carries in SSB — plain SSB takes audio
                  from the mic and the radio transmits <strong>no RF at all</strong>, a red TX light
                  and nothing on the air. <strong>Per radio</strong>, since it depends on how that
                  rig is cabled and set. True FSK RTTY is unaffected — it keeps the rig's own RTTY
                  mode.
