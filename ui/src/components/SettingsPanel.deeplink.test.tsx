// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// Settings deep links — the panel can be TOLD where to go.
//
// Before this, Settings always opened on the Station tab and took no target: the component had
// no prop for it, and there was not one `id` anchor or `scrollIntoView` call in its 8,000 lines.
// Meanwhile the app hard-coded ~228 "Settings ▸ …" pointers across the UI, the Rust toasts and
// the docs — prose that told an operator the path and then made them walk it. Setup Health's own
// RX-audio dot said "check the audio device below" and pointed 1,870 lines down a scroller.
//
// What is pinned here:
//  - a target opens the right TAB, including for a section that moved tabs in the nine-tab split;
//  - it SCROLLS the section into view (the anchor exists and is asked for);
//  - a target inside a COLLAPSED disclosure expands it — a control the operator still cannot see
//    has not been found, which is the Issue #62 failure exactly;
//  - a pointer written against a tab that no longer exists still lands (the alias resolver), so
//    the sweep of 228 prose pointers is not a prerequisite for shipping the split;
//  - an unrecognised target degrades to the default landing rather than blanking the panel.
