//! Window → radio-chain ADDRESSING (multi-radio phase 1b).
//!
//! This module answers exactly one question — *which radio does this window talk to?* — and
//! deliberately answers nothing else. It is **inert at runtime**: [`Chains`] holds exactly one
//! chain, no command consults it yet, and no caller passes an instance token yet.
//!
//! ## The address
//!
//! A surface is `(panel, instance)`. The instance is a validated TOKEN, never a bare number:
//!
//! | token   | meaning                                                             |
//! |---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `main`  | the docked surface in the main window                               |
//! | `w<n>`  | an extra UNBOUND surface (second-monitor board, torn-off sub-panel)  |
//! | `r<id>` | BOUND to the radio whose `RadioProfile::id` is `<id>`                |
//!
//! Grammar: `^(main|w[0-9]{1,3}|r[0-9]{1,9})$`, and additionally the digits must be canonical
//! (no leading zeros) so that token → label is a bijection. Without that, `r02` and `r2` are two
//! labels, two saved geometry files and two windows for **one** rig.
//!
//! **Why a token and not a `u32`.** A `u32` cannot tell `w2` from `r2`. Given the bare label
//! `panel-operate-2`, a resolver looking for a radio finds none and falls back to the primary
//! chain — rendering and *commanding* radio 1 in a window the operator opened for radio 2. That
//! is a wrong-rig bug, not a display bug, and the token makes it unrepresentable.
//!
//! **Why the chain comes from the WINDOW LABEL and not a command argument.** Same reason, one
//! level up: a call site that forgets to pass an argument would silently target the wrong
//! transmitter. The label is attached by the OS to the window the click happened in, so it
//! cannot be omitted. See [`chain_of`].
//!
//! **Ids are `RadioProfile::id`s, not a parallel numbering.** `r<id>` names a profile id
//! (`crates/tempo-app/src/settings.rs` — *"Stable id, never reused"*), so [`Chains`] is keyed by
//! the same ids. A migrated single-radio station is profile **0**, so chain ids start at 0 and
//! there is no synthetic "chain 1" constant anywhere.
//!
//! ## Why this module denies warnings on its own
//!
//! `src-tauri` is its own workspace root, so it was never linted by CI and carries a
//! pre-existing backlog (15 warnings at the time of writing: MSRV, type complexity, redundant
//! casts). `-D warnings` on the whole crate would therefore fail on day one, and burning that
//! backlog down is unrelated churn in a 10k-line `lib.rs`.
//!
//! So the deny is scoped HERE instead. Every wrong-rig property this step claims lives in this
//! file, and a lint regression in it is exactly what nobody would notice. The crate-wide gate is
//! backlog, tracked in `docs/multi-radio-rollback.md`.
