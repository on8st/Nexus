//! The Pounce detector — turns the inbound spot firehose into a rare, loud alert.
//!
//! The decision itself is pure and lives in `propagation::pounce`. This is the placement: a
//! channel the cluster feeds hand spots to, and a thread that does the expensive part.
//!
//! WHY A CHANNEL AND A THREAD, rather than scoring in the feed callback. That callback runs per
//! inbound spot on the RBN/cluster firehose, and scoring needs the operator's worked sets — which
//! means the engine lock, and rebuilding `LogNeeds` over the whole logbook. Doing that on the
//! ingest path would put expensive, lock-taking work on a hot producer. That is exactly the shape
//! that made the waterfall stall (see tempo-audio `rxtap.rs`, and
//! [[feedback-root-cause-not-bandaids]]): the callback's only job is a non-blocking handoff.
//!
//! THE COST MODEL. `LogNeeds` is derived from every logged QSO — at 11k contacts that is far too
//! expensive per spot. It is rebuilt on a slow cadence and cached; each arriving spot is then
//! scored against the cached snapshot, which is cheap. A needs snapshot that is a few tens of
//! seconds stale can at worst produce one late alert for a station just worked — and the gate's
//! own cooldown already covers that.
