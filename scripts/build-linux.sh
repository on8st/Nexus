# The signature Tauri makes HERE is over bytes the repack below replaces, so it is deleted the

# then fails verification. Deleting it is what makes that unrepresentable rather than merely
# avoided — after this point no `.sig` exists until the one made over the shipped bytes.
#

# --- The Wayland client library has to come from the HOST (#138) --------------------------------
#
# linuxdeploy's GTK plugin copies GTK's dependencies wholesale into the AppDir, and that sweeps in
# `libwayland-client.so.0`. A Wayland client library talks a protocol version to the compositor it
# finds at runtime, so it must be the HOST's copy — which is why it is on AppImage's own
# excludelist (`AppImage/pkg2appimage/excludelist`), and the plugin's bulk copy bypasses that list.
#
# Shipping ours meant Nexus opened to a blank white window on Fedora 44 (#138, M0LHJ): the bundled
# Ubuntu-built copy loses to the host's newer compositor, graphics init fails, nothing is drawn.
# His own workaround is the proof of the mechanism —
# `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libwayland-client.so.0` forces the system copy back in front and Nexus
# starts. Confusingly the app is not even a Wayland client: the AppRun forces `GDK_BACKEND=x11`,
# so this runs under XWayland and the library is still loaded further down the stack.
#
# ONLY that one library is removed. Its three siblings (`-egl`, `-cursor`, `-server`) are bundled
# too but are NOT on the excludelist, and nothing in the report points at them — removing them
# would be a guess, and a guess here is a build that fails to start for somebody else.
# ⚠️ AN ABSENT AppImage IS NORMAL, NOT AN ERROR. `scripts/Dockerfile.pi` seds the bundle list down
# to `--bundles deb` and runs this same script for both Raspberry Pi bases, so on those builds
# there is no AppImage to repack and nothing to sign. Failing here would take out both Pi jobs.

#
# linuxdeploy bundles GStreamer's ten CORE libraries and ZERO plugins, then unconditionally
# exports GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0 pointing INSIDE the AppImage at a directory it never
# created. Setting that variable suppresses GStreamer's default scan, so the host's plugins
# are not found either: measured on a real machine, 257 plugins visible normally, ONE with
# the AppImage's environment. The bundled libgstreamer is also relocatable and derives the
# same missing path on its own, so it is broken twice over.
#
# WebKitGTK implements Web Audio on GStreamer — appsrc and autoaudiosink for output, appsink
# for decodeAudioData — which is exactly the three elements an operator sees it fail to find:
#     GStreamer element appsink not found. Please install it.
# The band-edge tones, the alert sounds and the DXped alarm all go through Web Audio, so in
# the AppImage they simply never sound. RX/TX audio is untouched (that is native cpal).
#
# The plugins are COPIED IN rather than pointed at on the host, deliberately: a host with a
# newer GStreamer than the core libraries linuxdeploy bundled would fail in a different and
# harder-to-read way. These come from the same machine that supplied the core, so they match.
