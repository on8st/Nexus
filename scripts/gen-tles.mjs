// Build the amateur-satellite CATALOG mirror payload (tles.json + tles.txt).
//
// WHY A MIRROR: Celestrak's 2026 policies (a 2 h update cycle, one-download-
// per-cycle 403s on popular groups, per-IP caps, 50 HTTP errors in 2 h or
// 100 MB/day → firewall, and developers held responsible for their apps'
// fleet behavior) make every-install-fetches-directly a scaling liability.
// This script runs in CI every 6 h (.github/workflows/tles.yml) and publishes
// a rolling GitHub Release asset that hamradiotools.io/nexus/tles.json 302s
// to. Nexus installs refresh against the mirror with conditional GETs (the
// release asset serves an ETag; an unchanged set costs a ~300-byte 304) and
// touch Celestrak directly only as a narrow client-side fallback.
//
// WHY A UNION, NOT A GROUP: Celestrak's `GROUP=amateur` is 97 objects and
// roughly 40% derelict — measured against AMSAT's live status catalog, 60 of
// its birds had no report in 30 days, while 8 birds heard on the air THAT DAY
// (IO-86, Foresail-1p, SAKHACUBE, QMR-KWT 2, Ten-Koh 2, Marina, …) were not in
// it at all. The population the operator actually wants is SatNOGS's: alive
// satellites carrying a live amateur transmitter — 376 birds. So the mirror
// DERIVES the population from SatNOGS and then assembles elements for exactly
// those NORADs from three sources, in freshness order:
//   1. Celestrak GROUP=amateur   — the traditional set, Space-Track derived
//   2. Celestrak GROUP=satnogs   — purpose-built for this population (649)
//   3. SatNOGS /api/tle/         — 1668 records, and the ONLY source for the
//      ~334 birds with placeholder NORAD ids and for birds Celestrak 404s
//      (IO-86 / 40931 is SATCAT-operational, heard today, and gp.php?CATNR
//      answers "No GP data found").
//
// TWO TIERS, AND WHY. A bird is LISTED (a catalog row) on a far wider rule
// than it is DRAWN (published elements):
//   * ACTIVE  = the bird is IN ORBIT AND has at least one LIVE amateur
//     transmitter. Exactly this set gets elements — it is what "which bird can
//     I work" means. SatNOGS spelled "in orbit" as `alive` until 2026-08, when
//     it renamed the value and retired `dead`; both spellings are accepted and
//     the whole story is on IN_ORBIT_STATUSES, including what the retirement
//     of `dead` cost this predicate.
//   * LISTED  = every bird SatNOGS has ever given an amateur transmitter,
//     minus re-entries older than RECENT_DECAY_DAYS. So a bird that dies, goes
//     silent, or re-enters KEEPS ITS ROW, carrying the status that says why.
// The second tier is not decoration: the client's whole honesty story — the
// dead / re-entered / pre-launch / alive-but-silent chips, and a ★ bird that
// stays clickable after it stops working — is unreachable without it. Publish
// only the active set and a starred bird that dies simply ceases to exist: no
// row in the birds list, none in the excluded list, no ★ left to switch off.
// Measured: 443 listed, 381 alive (376 of them active), 6 dead, 17 pre-launch,
// 39 recently re-entered. Elements are NOT published for the inactive tier —
// SGP4 on a decayed object is a fiction, and a bird with nothing left to work
// belongs in a row, not on the map.
//
// NO PER-CATNR LOOP — deliberately. The three legs above leave 5 of 376 birds
// uncovered, and a per-CATNR fetch does not rescue them: both measured
// remainders (40931, 61757) answer HTTP 404. A loop over the uncovered set
// would spend its whole budget on 404s, and 50 of those inside 2 h firewalls
// the mirror's IP on its first pass. Uncovered birds are REPORTED (in the job
// log, and in the catalog as an entry with no `src`) rather than hammered for.
//
// IDENTITY — the single most load-bearing rule. SatNOGS mints placeholder
// NORAD ids in the 98xxx/99xxx range for birds USSPACECOM has not catalogued;
// 194 of them carry `norad_follow_id` = the real number once assigned. The
// rule is ASYMMETRIC, and inverting it silently loses 176 birds:
//   * Celestrak lookups, de-duplication, published identity → follow id
//   * SatNOGS /api/tle/ lookups                             → raw cat id
// Both ids are therefore tried against every element source, and the WINNING
// element line's NORAD becomes the published identity — the client keys birds
// by that number, so a catalog row that disagrees is a status stamped on the
// wrong bird (gate 9).
//
// SANITY GATES — ANY failure publishes NOTHING (exit 1; the Release keeps its
// last good asset, which clients re-validate on their side anyway; the Rust
// twin of gates 4–8 is propagation::live::tle::validate_tles):
//   1. Every fetch HTTP 200, and no Celestrak non-data 200 body — "No GP data
//      found" (cold cache) or "GP data has not updated since your last
//      successful download" (in-cycle refusal). Neither may read as zero
//      satellites. A 403/404 STOPS the run; it is never retried.
//   2. The amateur derivation is sane: listed population size in range, the
//      ACTIVE set's share of the alive catalog in range, and BOTH clauses
//      (`service == "Amateur"` and the ITU-band match) still finding birds on
//      their own — a fraction gate alone cannot see one clause going dark,
//      because the band clause is a strict superset of the service clause.
//   3. Bird count >= max(floor, ceil(0.85 × previous UNION count)) — the
//      ratchet against the previously published manifest catches a silent
//      mass shrink a fixed floor would wave through. TLES_RATCHET_OVERRIDE
//      waives it for ONE run (see the env seams below).
//   4. Bird count <= ceiling (a wrong or merged group would balloon).
//   5. Every NORAD numeric and unique.
//   6. Canaries: NORAD 25544 (ISS) present, plus at least 6 of the 7
//      most-worked birds — SO-50, RS-44, AO-91, AO-7, PO-101, AO-73, ISS. The
//      "6 of 7" shape is deliberate: requiring all seven stalls the mirror the
//      day one re-enters, requiring none cannot see the derivation breaking.
//      SO-50 in particular is the canary for the band clause — SatNOGS calls
//      every one of its transmitters `service: "Unknown"`.
//   7. Every element line exactly 69 chars with a valid mod-10 checksum. A
//      failing line drops its BIRD; more than max(1, 2% of candidates)
//      dropping means the payload is bad, not the birds, and refuses the run.
//      The floor of one is deliberate: a single corrupt line in a 376-bird
//      feed must cost that bird, never the whole mirror cycle.
//   8. Epoch freshness: median age <= 7 d, p90 <= 30 d, AND at least 60% of
//      birds under 3 d. Median-shaped, NEVER max — AO-10 is legitimately old
//      and must not fail a fresh set. The p90 ceiling is 30 d rather than the
//      group era's 14 because the union deliberately carries a long tail
//      Celestrak does not (measured: 330 of 371 within 7 d, 348 within 30).
//      The under-3-d floor exists to mirror the CLIENT's stricter rule:
//      validate_tles refuses any set with fewer than half its birds under 3 d,
//      so publishing one would age every install's elements for nothing.
//   9. Identity: every catalog entry claiming elements has them, under exactly
//      its own NORAD, and no element is published for a bird outside the
//      ACTIVE population.
//  10. Round-trip: re-serializing the parsed set and re-parsing it yields
//      identical elements (parser/format drift dies here, not on clients).
//
// Output:
//   tles.json — manifest-is-payload: {schema, generated, source, attribution,
//               count, catalogCount, medianEpochAgeDays, sources, elements,
//               catalog}. `elements` keys match crates/propagation sat::Tle
//               serde; `catalog` is the status-bearing bird list (norad, name,
//               SatNOGS status, amateur, decayed, `classes`, element source).
//               THE CLIENT CONTRACT is `MirrorManifest` in crates/propagation
//               live::tle: it deserializes `generated`, `elements` AND
//               `catalog` — the catalog has been consumed since it landed, and
//               is re-serialized into the client's own on-disk cache. What
//               keeps a new field ADDITIVE is not that clients ignore the
//               catalog, it is that every catalog field but norad/name/status
//               defaults and unknown keys are ignored: `schema`, `count`,
//               `catalogCount`, `medianEpochAgeDays`, `sources` and `source`
//               are publisher bookkeeping no client reads, and an older build
//               parses this manifest whole — it just cannot see the new field.
//               `classes` is what an operator WORKS the bird with, derived
//               from its live transmitters — any of linear / fm / digital /
//               beacon, in that order, and possibly several at once (see
//               `classifyTransmitter`). It stays on `schema: 2` for exactly
//               that reason, and the round trip runs BOTH ways: a build that
//               predates the field rewrites its cache without it, so absence
//               must read as "not classified" forever, never as a guess.
//               `attribution` travels INSIDE the payload (the same rule the
//               repo's other BY-SA source follows) so the licence survives the
//               file being copied out of the release asset.
//   tles.txt  — the union as raw 3LE text (the operator import path).

//   TLES_RATCHET_OVERRIDE — set to 1 to waive gate 3 for THIS RUN, logging the

//                           workflow_dispatch only, never on the schedule: it
//                           exists for the ONE step change the ratchet is
//                           right to refuse (the 97-bird group → 376-bird
//                           union cutover), not as a way to live without it.
//   TLES_NOW              — override "now" (unix seconds or ISO date) for the

//                           same way forever.
